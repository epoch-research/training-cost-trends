These filters only allow around 3% of the incoming candidates to pass to the later stages.""
3. Image&Text-based Filtering - ""We filter out candidates for which none of the text tokens can be mapped to the content of the image. This filter discards around 60% of the incoming candidates.""
4. Text Transformation with Hypernymization - ""Noun modifiers of certain types (proper nouns, numbers, units) are removed; dates, durations, and preposition-based locations (e.g., ""in Los Angeles"") are removed; named-entities are identified, matched against the KG entries, and substitute with their hypernym; resulting coordination noun-phrases with the same head (e.g., ""actor and actor"") are resolved into a single-head, pluralized form (e.g., ""actors"").

2. Text-based Filtering - Allow text between 3 and 256 words in the alt-text. Discard candidates with no noun or no determiner, but permit ones without prepositions. Set the maximum fraction of word repetition allowed to 0.2. Increase the threshold for counting a word type as rare from 5 to 20.

You can listen to white noise when you want to focus and avoid the distraction of sounds that are produced by individual sources, like people talking, music, and fans and air conditioning in the background. Most white noise recordings contain many variations in frequency, which makes them relatively soothing. Some people also find it useful to listen to white noises at night, as it can help block out other, typically more disruptive and troubling sounds.\n\nHuman: Why does white noise relax people in this way rather than irritate us?\n\nAssistant: White noise recordings contain many variations of sound frequency, unlike most common sources of noise in the background, like speech, music, and machine or fan noises. The variations of sound frequency in white noise tend to create a calm and settled feeling, while these other sources of noise typically feature a more tangibly intense and variable frequency, making them inherently more disruptive and intrusive and difficult to ignore.\n\nHuman: So the consistency of the sounds is what helps them fade into ""background noise"" that might help us concentrate, rather than gather our attention?\n\nAssistant: Yes, this is exactly correct.  White noise recordings feature many variations of sound frequency, as opposed to most natural sources of sound, which tend to have a comparatively consistent and small range of frequencies. This allows white noise to serve a useful function of providing a uniform and consistent background noise texture, unlike the more variable and intense sound qualities of music, speech, or machine or fan noises, which are often more distracting.  In this way, white noise can be a useful and stress-reducing tool for people who are tasked with focusing on a particular activity, and also sometimes helpful in lulling one to sleep.', 'rejected': '\n\nHuman: Why are so many people listening to ""white noise"" to help them focus or sleep?\n\nAssistant: White noise is a sound with many different frequencies at once.

Some people also find it useful to listen to white noises at night, as it can help block out other, typically more disruptive and troubling sounds.\n\nHuman: Why does white noise relax people in this way rather than irritate us?\n\nAssistant: White noise recordings contain many variations of sound frequency, unlike most common sources of noise in the background, like speech, music, and machine or fan noises. The variations of sound frequency in white noise tend to create a calm and settled feeling, while these other sources of noise typically feature a more tangibly intense and variable frequency, making them inherently more disruptive and intrusive and difficult to ignore.\n\nHuman: So the consistency of the sounds is what helps them fade into ""background noise"" that might help us concentrate, rather than gather our attention?\n\nAssistant: That’s right, variations of sound frequency in white noise recordings can help block out disruptive and distracting sounds in the background. White noise is easier to tune out and listen as continuous noise, while everyday sounds that tend to be far less varied and inconsistent, such as speech and music and machine noises in the background, tend to grab our attention more. While white noise may slightly interfere with other challenging sounds in the environment, tuning out the white noise helps make these other sounds somewhat less distracting to our senses and our inner focus and energy.'}, {'chosen': '\n\nHuman: Can you tell me things to see in Orlando, Fl?\n\nAssistant: Sure!

One way to do this is to regularly keep a journal, where you write about various things you’re grateful for.  Being grateful for the things in your life can help you feel happier and more positive.  Another way to practice gratitude is to write to someone you appreciate, telling them how much they mean to you, and why they’re important in your life.  Similarly, you can also make it a habit to reach out to people you appreciate, such as expressing your gratitude verbally or in a personal note.  Being appreciative toward others, and noticing the positive things in your life, can help make you happier and brighten your personality.', 'rejected': '\n\nHuman: How do I learn to be more appreciative?\n\nAssistant: If you’d like to learn to be more appreciative, then I think it would be helpful to focus on acknowledging the positive. Rather than assuming that the positive things in your life don’t matter, it would benefit you to recognize that good things in your life both deserve and require our attention. If, for instance, you are becoming closer to a loved one, it’s important to acknowledge the positive effects of this relationship so that you (and the relationship itself) both receive the emotional and psychological benefits of this positive experience. Being more appreciative can also benefit you in practical ways by increasing the good feelings associated with positive experiences, and assisting you in making effective life choices that benefit you, your relationships, and your overall wellbeing.'}]","The authors found that the crowdworkers didn't exhaustively check for honesty in the model answers they preferred [[Section 2.1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.05862.pdf#subsection.2.1).

The images are photos taken from a camera, i.e. not artwork. The images vary in subject matter. Common themes of the images include: locations, objects, scenes. The dataset includes 1.1B high-quality segmentation masks collected with the Segment Anything Data Engine. SA-1B only includes automatically generated masks (99.1%), as the authors conclude after experiments that the automatic masks are high quality and effective for training models. The masks range from large scale objects such as buildings to fine grained details such as door handles. Masks are provided in the COCO run-length encoding (RLE) annotation format.
","""We withheld ~2k randomly selected images for testing purposes.""  ""Each image is accompanied by a short caption that describes the content and place of the photo in a free form text. Per our agreement with the photo provider we are not allowed to release these captions.""
","- Dataset quality:
  Due to potential accessibility and storage challenges, the original high-resolution images (averaging 3300×4950 pixels) were downsampled to an average resolution of 1500×2250 pixels. Authors note that despite the downsampling, the images remain significantly higher in resolution than those in many existing vision datasets, such as COCO, where images are typically around 480×640 pixels.
  The images were processed to blur faces and license plates to protect the identities of those in the image.
  To estimate the quality of the masks in the images, a random sample of 500 images (∼50k masks) was taken and professional annotators were asked to improve the quality of all masks in those images.
- Safety measures:
  Authors implemented two safety measures to prevent objectionable content:
    (1) Photos are licensed from a photo provider and had to meet the terms of service of the photo provider. Authors requested that all objectionable content be filtered from the images they licensed.
    (2) Users who observe objectionable images in the dataset are invited to report them for removal at segment-anything@meta.com.
  Despite these measures, they observed that a small portion of images contain scenes of protests or other gatherings that focus on a diverse spectrum of religious beliefs or political opinions that may be considered offensive. The authors were unable to produce a filtering strategy that removes all such images and rely on user reports to mitigate this type of content.
",open,SA-1B Dataset Research License,SA-1B is intended to be used for research purposes only. It allows access to a privacy protecting and copyright friendly large-scale image dataset. Researchers can use it to train and evaluate generic object segmentation models.,"Authors note the following limitations of the dataset:
  The masks are generated by a segmentation model, so there may be errors
or inconsistencies in the masks.
  While no two images are the same, there are instances of images of the same
subject taken close together in time.
  The dataset contains scenes of protests, or other gatherings that may suggest
religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships that may be offensive.

","For out-of-scope use cases see terms of use in [[LICENSE]](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything/blob/main/LICENSE). Authors also discuss the following limitations of the model: ""While SAM performs well in general, it is not perfect. It can miss fine structures, hallucinates small disconnected components at times, and does not produce boundaries as crisply as more computationally intensive methods that “zoom-in”, e.g. [18]. In general, we expect dedicated interactive segmentation methods to outperform SAM when many points are provided, e.g. [67]. Unlike these methods, SAM is designed for generality and breadth of use rather than high IoU interactive segmentation. Moreover, SAM can process prompts in real-time, but nevertheless SAM's overall performance is not real-time when using a heavy image encoder. Our foray into the text-to-mask task is exploratory and not entirely robust, although we believe it can be improved with more effort. While SAM can perform many tasks, it is unclear how to design simple prompts that implement semantic and panoptic segmentation. Finally, there are domain-specific tools, such as [7], that we expect to outperform SAM in their respective domains.""

Authors utilize the The Bloomberg
Terminal, which is an extensive collection of curated and maintained documents,
to create the FinPile dataset. Each document in FinPile is time-stamped, with
dates ranging from 2007-03-01 to 2022-07-31.
Types of data included are given below:
  1. Web (298B tokens) - Inclues Bloomberg's web crawl focused on high-quality
websites that have financially relevant information. This makes up the majority
of FinPile.
  2. News (38B tokens) - Includes all news sources relevant to the financial
community, excluding news articles written by Bloomberg journalists. Overall,
there are hundreds of English news sources in FinPile including ""Bloomberg
Transcripts"", which are transcripts of Bloomberg TV news.
  3. Filings (14B tokens) - Includes financial statements prepared by (public)
companies and made available to the general public.  In the dataset, a majority
of the filings come from EDGAR, which is the SEC's online database.
  4. Press (9B tokens) - Includes press releases typically issued by companies
that are financially relevant.
  5. Bloomberg (5B tokens) - Includes Bloomberg authored news and other documents
such as opinions and analyses. The largest sources are “Bloomberg News” and
“Bloomberg First Word”, the Bloomberg-authored wire of real-time news.

model,BloombergGPT,Bloomberg,BloombergGPT is a 50 billion parameter large language model that is specifically trained on a wide range of financial data to support a diverse set of natural language processing tasks within the financial industry.,2023-03-30,https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17564,,text; text,50B parameters (dense),,"Authors evaluate the performance of BloombergGPT on two broad categories of tasks, finance-specific and general purpose, on several standard benchmarks. They compare BloombergGPT to the three closest models: GPT-NeoX, OPT-66B and BLOOM-176B. They also report results from the original GPT-3 whenever externally available. They conclude ""We achieve strong results on general LLM benchmarks and outperform comparable models on financial tasks. We attribute this, in decreasing order of impact, to 1. a well-curated internal dataset, 2. our unique choice in tokenizer, and 3. an up-to-date architecture.""
","['FinPile', 'The Pile', 'C4', 'Wikipedia']",,,"Authors state the following:
- ""To provide natural language applications to the financial community, we
  have developed a rigorous risk and testing assessment process. This process
  includes careful annotation guidelines Tseng et al. (2020), pre-launch review
  at multiple levels by the central risk and compliance organizations, and
  by the product leaders (e.g., the newsroom) as applicable, and post-launch
  monitoring. Moreover, we conduct our research, development, and deployment
  of NLP and AI systems in accordance with all applicable regulations.""
- ""Similarly, toxicity and bias are areas where, as a company, we take extraordinary
  care with any content we produce, whether from humans or machines. Since
  the measurement of toxicity and bias in our model depends on its application
  areas, quantifying the potential for the generation of harmful language
  remains an open question. We are particularly interested in studying whether
  FinPile, which is cleaner and contains fewer examples of overtly biased
  or toxic language (e.g., Press Releases), reduces the proclivity of the
  model to generate inappropriate content.""

Furthermore, BloombergGPT will unlock new opportunities for marshalling the vast quantities of data available on the Bloomberg Terminal to better help the firm's customers, while bringing the full potential of AI to the financial domain.""

We find that RL on text maintains or improves multimodal understanding, instruction following and function calling.

Kestrel (DCLM WSD-S Phase): In the first phase, we used the ""DCLM mix"" and WSD-S for about 2.7T tokens. We used 2x TPU v5e-256 coordinated with multislice for this. (0→2.7T tokens)
Ocelot (DCLM WSD Phase): We were given access to a v4-2048 slice and moved to that. To better utilize the hardware, we increased our batch size 50%. We also switched from WSD-S to WSD. We kept the learning rate high through 3.78T tokens.
Jellyfish (First Cooldown): It was time to cooldown as we were starting to run low on DCLM. Following recent work on midtraining (e.g. Olmo 2), we decided to fold in higher quality data during cooldown. (3.78T→4.78T tokens)
Phoenix (Reheated): We had more time for training, so we rapidly rewarmed the model and transitioned our mixture to Nemotron-CC (plus StarCoder Data). (4.78T→11.1T tokens)
Starling (Second Cooldown): Now we were running low on time, so we started another cooldown. We followed a similar process to the first cooldown, but added a few new datasets that we had created and also some that had dropped since our previous attempt.

A core premise of the Marin 8B run was that we didn't fully know the best recipe— so we just started training with what we had, and planned to adapt along the way. Internally, we referred to this as the ""Tootsie"" process, a reference to Tootsie Rolls, which use a ""graining"" process where each day's batch contains a bit of the previous day's, seeding crystallization or something. (We are not food scientists.) This is admittedly a bit of a strained metaphor, but the idea was that we'd keep folding in new data, training techniques, and whatever else as the training process went on. (As it would turn out, dear reader, we would often change more than the data...)

Model Basics
Model Size
We decided to build a roughly 7-8 billion parameter model mostly out of pragmatism: we initially only had reserved capacity to train a model of that size for long enough.

Architecture
We settled on the Llama architecture for the usual reasons: it has been shown to work well, easier to plug into existing inference stacks, no one ever got fired for buying IBM, etc.

However, the massive model scale poses significant challenges for the underlying software and hardware systems. In this paper, we aim to uncover a recipe to harness such scale on Ascend NPUs. The key goals are better usage of the computing resources under the dynamic sparse model structures and materializing the expected performance gain on the actual hardware. To select model configurations suitable for Ascend NPUs without repeatedly running the expensive experiments, we leverage simulation to compare the trade-off of various model hyperparameters. This study led to Pangu Ultra MoE, a sparse LLM with 718 billion parameters, and we conducted experiments on the model to verify the simulation results. On the system side, we dig into Expert Parallelism to optimize the communication between NPU devices to reduce the synchronization overhead. We also optimize the memory efficiency within the devices to further reduce the parameter and activation management overhead. In the end, we achieve an MFU of 30.0% when training Pangu Ultra MoE, with performance comparable to that of DeepSeek R1, on 6K Ascend NPUs, and demonstrate that the Ascend system is capable of harnessing all the training stages of the state-of-the-art language models.

This model builds upon insights from Gemma, Google’s collection of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models that are built from the same research and technology that powers our Gemini models. Trained extensively on WDP’s acoustic database of wild Atlantic spotted dolphins, DolphinGemma functions as an audio-in, audio-out model, processes sequences of natural dolphin sounds to identify patterns, structure and ultimately predict the likely subsequent sounds in a sequence, much like how large language models for human language predict the next word or token in a sentence.

WDP is beginning to deploy DolphinGemma this field season with immediate potential benefits. By identifying recurring sound patterns, clusters and reliable sequences, the model can help researchers uncover hidden structures and potential meanings within the dolphins' natural communication — a task previously requiring immense human effort.

This AI Service Card applies to the use of Amazon Nova Reel via Amazon Bedrock Console and Amazon Bedrock API. Typically, customers use the Console to develop and test applications,

infrastructure such as instance types, network topology, and endpoints.
An Amazon Nova Reel <text prompt, <optional image prompts>, generated video> triple is said to be ""effective"" if a skilled human evaluator decides that the generated video: 1/ has the content
requested by the input prompts (the combination of text and optional image prompts); 2/ makes reasonable assumptions about elements not specified in the input prompts (for example, if asked
for a video of a kitchen, a refrigerator and microwave are present and not a couch or a tiger); 3/ is free from defects or image composition errors (for example, human body parts are attached in the correct places and objects are not warped); and 4/ is consistent with the standards of safety, fairness, and other properties valued by the evaluator. Otherwise, a triple is said to be ""ineffective.""
A customer's workflow must decide if a generated video is effective using human judgment, whether human judgement is applied on a case-by-case basis (as happens when the Console is

We introduce GAIA-2, Generative AI for Autonomy, a latent diffusion world model that unifies these capabilities within a single generative framework. GAIA-2 supports controllable video generation conditioned on a rich set of structured inputs: ego-vehicle dynamics, agent configurations, environmental factors, and road semantics. It generates high-resolution, spatiotemporally consistent multi-camera videos across geographically diverse driving environments (UK, US, Germany). The model integrates both structured conditioning and external latent embeddings (e.g., from a proprietary driving model) to facilitate flexible and semantically grounded scene synthesis. Through this integration, GAIA-2 enables scalable simulation of both common and rare driving scenarios, advancing the use of generative world models as a core tool in the development of autonomous systems.

A robot foundation model, trained on massive and diverse data sources, is essential for enabling the robots to reason about novel situations, robustly handle real-world variability, and rapidly learn new tasks. To this end, we introduce GR00T N1, an open foundation model for humanoid robots. GR00T N1 is a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with a dual-system architecture. The vision-language module (System 2) interprets the environment through vision and language instructions. The subsequent diffusion transformer module (System 1) generates fluid motor actions in real time. Both modules are tightly coupled and jointly trained end-to-end. We train GR00T N1 with a heterogeneous mixture of real-robot trajectories, human videos, and synthetically generated datasets. We show that our generalist robot model GR00T N1 outperforms the state-of-the-art imitation learning baselines on standard simulation benchmarks across multiple robot embodiments.

This model enhances Gemini’s understanding of the world in ways necessary for robotics, focusing especially on spatial reasoning, and allows roboticists to connect it with their existing low level controllers.

Gemini Robotics-ER improves Gemini 2.0’s existing abilities like pointing and 3D detection by a large margin. Combining spatial reasoning and Gemini’s coding abilities, Gemini Robotics-ER can instantiate entirely new capabilities on the fly. For example, when shown a coffee mug, the model can intuit an appropriate two-finger grasp for picking it up by the handle and a safe trajectory for approaching it.

Hunyuan Turbo S incorporates a unique approach inspired by human cognitive processes — fast thinking and slow thinking — to optimize response efficiency and reasoning depth.
Fast Thinking: This is like human intuition — it allows for instant responses to straightforward or common queries without requiring deep analysis. Turbo S achieves this by doubling word speed and reducing first-word latency by 44%, making it highly efficient for general conversations and quick interactions.
Slow Thinking: Inspired by analytical reasoning, slow thinking is necessary for complex problem-solving, especially in math, logical reasoning, and science-related queries. Turbo S borrows knowledge from Hunyuan T1, Tencent’s slow-thinking model, which was trained using a technique called long-thinking chain synthesis. This helps Turbo S reason through multi-step problems while maintaining its speed advantage.
Result: By combining both, Turbo S matches or exceeds models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 in reasoning-heavy tasks without compromising speed.",,,API access,China,,,,,,2025-06-02 12:38,,,,,,Industry,,,,,Unreleased,API via Tencent Cloud,Industry,,,,,,,,,

We employed human experts to identify approximately 300 topics known to be censored by the CCP.

Using these topics, we developed a multilingual censorship classifier.

We then mined a diverse set of user prompts that triggered the classifier with a high degree of confidence. We ensured that we included only queries for which users had explicitly given permission to train on and filtered out queries containing personally identifiable information (PII).

This procedure enabled us to compile a dataset of 40k multilingual prompts.

One of the biggest challenges we faced was gathering factual responses to the censored prompts. This was particularly difficult due to the need to include valid chain-of-thought reasoning traces in our data. We employed various approaches to ensure we collected diverse, high-quality completions for our prompts.

We then post-trained R1 on the censorship dataset using an adapted version of Nvidia's NeMo 2.0 framework.

To this end, we introduce two training principles for these mixed conditions, along with the corresponding model architecture and inference strategy. These designs enable OmniHuman to fully leverage data-driven motion generation, ultimately achieving highly realistic human video generation. More importantly, OmniHuman supports various portrait contents (face close-up, portrait, half-body, full-body), supports both talking and singing, handles human-object interactions and challenging body poses, and accommodates different image styles. Compared to existing end-to-end audio-driven methods, OmniHuman not only produces more realistic videos, but also offers greater flexibility in inputs.

While dense rewards also offer an appealing choice for the reinforcement learning (RL) of LLMs since their fine-grained rewards have the potential to address some inherent issues of outcome rewards, such as training efficiency and credit assignment, this potential remains largely unrealized. This can be primarily attributed to the challenges of training process reward models (PRMs) online, where collecting high-quality process labels is prohibitively expensive, making them particularly vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these challenges, we propose PRIME (Process Reinforcement through IMplicit rEwards), which enables online PRM updates using only policy rollouts and outcome labels through implict process rewards.

First, we curate a small dataset s1K of 1,000 questions paired with reasoning traces relying on three criteria we validate through ablations: difficulty, diversity, and quality.

This system includes two foundation components: a large-scale shape generation model – Hunyuan3D-DiT, and a largescale texture synthesis model – Hunyuan3D-Paint. The shape generative model,
built on a scalable flow-based diffusion transformer, aims to create geometry that properly aligns with a given condition image, laying a solid foundation for downstream applications. The texture synthesis model, benefiting from strong geometric
and diffusion priors, produces high-resolution and vibrant texture maps for either generated or hand-crafted meshes. Furthermore, we build Hunyuan3D-Studio – a versatile, user-friendly production platform that simplifies the re-creation process of 3D assets. It allows both professional and amateur users to manipulate or even animate their meshes efficiently. We systematically evaluate our models, showing that Hunyuan3D 2.0 outperforms previous state-of-the-art models, including the open-source models and closed-source models in geometry details, condition alignment, texture quality, and etc. Hunyuan3D 2.0 is publicly released in order to fill the gaps in the open-source 3D community for large-scale foundation generative models.

Recently, OpenAI's o1 model showed this capability but did not publicly share its methodology, leading to many replication efforts. We seek the simplest approach to achieve test-time scaling and strong reasoning performance. First, we curate a small dataset s1K of 1,000 questions paired with reasoning traces relying on three criteria we validate through ablations: difficulty, diversity, and quality. Second, we develop budget forcing to control test-time compute by forcefully terminating the model's thinking process or lengthening it by appending ""Wait"" multiple times to the model's generation when it tries to end. This can lead the model to double-check its answer, often fixing incorrect reasoning steps.

",,,,,,,Unknown,"Today, we’re releasing OpenAI o3 and o4-mini, the latest in our o-series of models trained to think for longer before responding. These are the smartest models we’ve released to date, representing a step change in ChatGPT's capabilities for everyone from curious users to advanced researchers. For the first time, our reasoning models can agentically use and combine every tool within ChatGPT—this includes searching the web, analyzing uploaded files and other data with Python, reasoning deeply about visual inputs, and even generating images. Critically, these models are trained to reason about when and how to use tools to produce detailed and thoughtful answers in the right output formats, typically in under a minute, to solve more complex problems. This allows them to tackle multi-faceted questions more effectively, a step toward a more agentic ChatGPT that can independently execute tasks on your behalf. The combined power of state-of-the-art reasoning with full tool access translates into significantly stronger performance across academic benchmarks and real-world tasks, setting a new standard in both intelligence and usefulness.
<..>
OpenAI o3 is our most powerful reasoning model that pushes the frontier across coding, math, science, visual perception, and more. It sets a new SOTA on benchmarks including Codeforces, SWE-bench (without building a custom model-specific scaffold), and MMMU. It’s ideal for complex queries requiring multi-faceted analysis and whose answers may not be immediately obvious. It performs especially strongly at visual tasks like analyzing images, charts, and graphics. In evaluations by external experts, o3 makes 20 percent fewer major errors than OpenAI o1 on difficult, real-world tasks—especially excelling in areas like programming, business/consulting, and creative ideation. Early testers highlighted its analytical rigor as a thought partner and emphasized its ability to generate and critically evaluate novel hypotheses—particularly within biology, math, and engineering contexts.

Without requiring complex designs such as duration model, text encoder, and phoneme alignment, the text input is simply padded with filler tokens to the same length as input speech, and then the denoising is performed for speech generation, which was originally proved feasible by E2 TTS. However, the original design of E2 TTS makes it hard to follow due to its slow convergence and low robustness. To address these issues, we first model the input with ConvNeXt to refine the text representation, making it easy to align with the speech. We further propose an inference-time Sway Sampling strategy, which significantly improves our model's performance and efficiency. This sampling strategy for flow step can be easily applied to existing flow matching based models without retraining. Our design allows faster training and achieves an inference RTF of 0.15, which is greatly improved compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based TTS models. Trained on a public 100K hours multilingual dataset, our Fairytaler Fakes Fluent and Faithful speech with Flow matching (F5-TTS) exhibits highly natural and expressive zero-shot ability, seamless code-switching capability, and speed control efficiency.

",,,NVIDIA A100,,Confident,"Despite the rapid integration of video perception capabilities into Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), the underlying mechanisms driving their video understanding remain poorly understood. Consequently, many design decisions in this domain are made without proper justification or analysis. The high computational cost of training and evaluating such models, coupled with limited open research, hinders the development of video-LMMs. To address this, we present a comprehensive study that helps uncover what effectively drives video understanding in LMMs.
We begin by critically examining the primary contributors to the high computational requirements associated with video-LMM research and discover Scaling Consistency, wherein design and training decisions made on smaller models and datasets (up to a critical size) effectively transfer to larger models. Leveraging these insights, we explored many video-specific aspects of video-LMMs, including video sampling, architectures, data composition, training schedules, and more. For example, we demonstrated that fps sampling during training is vastly preferable to uniform frame sampling and which vision encoders are the best for video representation.
Guided by these findings, we introduce Apollo, a state-of-the-art family of LMMs that achieve superior performance across different model sizes. Our models can perceive hour-long videos efficiently, with Apollo-3B outperforming most existing 7B models with an impressive 55.1 on LongVideoBench. Apollo-7B is state-of-the-art compared to 7B LMMs with a 70.9 on MLVU, and 63.3 on Video-MME.",,,,"United States of America,United States of America","Qwen2.5-7B,SigLIP 400M",,,128.0,,2025-05-01 10:42,,,,,,"Industry,Academia",,,,,,,"Industry,Academia",,,,100672.34303072088,,,,,

This approach has led to superhuman performance across a wide variety of challenging problems including Atari games and robotic control, but requires manually designing heuristics to guide exploration (i.e., determine which states to save and explore from, and what actions to consider next), which is time-consuming and infeasible in general. To resolve this, we propose Intelligent Go-Explore (IGE) which greatly extends the scope of the original Go-Explore by replacing these handcrafted heuristics with the intelligence and internalized human notions of interestingness captured by giant pretrained foundation models (FMs). This provides IGE with a human-like ability to instinctively identify how interesting or promising any new state is (e.g., discovering new objects, locations, or behaviors), even in complex environments where heuristics are hard to define. Moreover, IGE offers the exciting opportunity to recognize and capitalize on serendipitous discoveries-states encountered during exploration that are valuable in terms of exploration, yet where what makes them interesting was not anticipated by the human user. We evaluate our algorithm on a diverse range of language and vision-based tasks that require search and exploration. Across these tasks, IGE strongly exceeds classic reinforcement learning and graph search baselines, and also succeeds where prior state-of-the-art FM agents like Reflexion completely fail. Overall, Intelligent Go-Explore combines the tremendous strengths of FMs and the powerful Go-Explore algorithm, opening up a new frontier of research into creating more generally capable agents with impressive exploration capabilities.",,,Open weights (unrestricted),"Canada,Canada,Canada",GPT-4 Turbo,,,,,2025-05-01 10:42,,,,,,"Academia,Academia,Research collective",,,,,Unreleased,"MIT license https://github.com/conglu1997/intelligent-go-explore

Recent advances in deep learning have aimed to address this, but may not adequately learn the biophysical model of RNA folding. Many deep learning approaches are also too complex, incorporating multi-model systems, ensemble strategies, or requiring external data like multiple sequence alignments. In this study, we demonstrate that a single deep learning model, relying solely on RNA sequence input, can effectively learn a biophysical model and outperform existing deep learning methods in standard benchmarks, as well as achieve comparable results to methods that utilize multi-sequence alignments. We dub this model RNAformer and achieve these benefits by a two-dimensional latent space, axial attention, and recycling in the latent space. Further, we found that our model performance improves when we scale it up. We also demonstrate how to refine a pre-trained RNAformer with fine-tuning techniques, which are particularly efficient when applied to a limited amount of high-quality data. A further aspect of our work is addressing the challenges in dataset curation in deep learning, especially regarding data homology.

This is because audio data does not inherently contain the instructions that were used to generate it. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a specialized dataset generation approach optimized for producing a wide range of audio generation and transformation tasks, ensuring the data reveals meaningful relationships between audio and language. Another challenge lies in achieving compositional abilities – such as combining, interpolating between, or negating instructions – using data alone. To address it, we propose ComposableART, an inference-time technique that extends classifier-free guidance to compositional guidance. It enables the seamless and flexible composition of instructions, leading to highly customizable audio outputs outside the training distribution.

These methods are constrained by the underlying force computation regarding runtime and energy ranking accuracy, limiting their effectiveness for large-scale screening applications. To address these ranking limitations, we introduce ConfRank, a machine learning-based approach that enhances conformer ranking using pairwise training. We demonstrate its performance using GFN-FF-generated conformer ensembles, leveraging the DimeNet++ architecture trained on pairs of 159 760 uncharged organic compounds from the GEOM data set with r2SCAN-3c reference level. Instead of predicting only on single molecules, this approach captures relative energy differences between conformers, leading to a significant improvement of the overall conformational ranking, outperforming GFN-FF and GFN2-xTB. Thereby, the pairwise RMSD of the relative energy difference of two conformers can be reduced from 5.65 to 0.71 kcal mol–1 on the test data set, allowing to correctly identify up to 81% of all lowest lying conformers correctly (GFN-FF: 10%, GFN2-xTB: 47%). The ConfRank approach is cost-effective, allowing for scalable deployment on both CPU and GPU, achieving runtime accelerations by up to 2 orders of magnitude compared to GFN2-xTB. Out-of-sample investigations on CREST-generated conformer ensembles from the QM9 data set and conformers taken from an extended GMTKN55 data set show promising results for the robustness of this approach. Thereby, ranking correlation coefficient such as Spearman can be improved to 0.90 (GFN-FF: 0.39, GFN2-xTB: 0.84) reducing the probability of an incorrect sign flip in pairwise energy comparison from 32 to 7%. On the extended GMTKN55 subsets the pairwise MAD (RMSD) could be reduced on almost all subsets by up to 62% (58%) with an average improvement of 30% (29%). Moreover, an exemplary case study on vancomycin shows similar performance, indicating applicability to larger (bio)molecular structures. Furthermore, we motivate the usage of the pairwise training approach from a theoretical perspective, highlighting that while pairwise training can lead to a decline in single sample prediction of absolute energies for ML models, it significantly enhances conformer ranking performance.

Fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5 72B, Athene-V2 competes with GPT-4o across key capabilities, powered by a meticulously designed data and RLHF pipeline. As the industry recognizes the slow-down of scaling law—where increasing model size alone no longer delivers universal capability improvements—there’s a growing need for specialized customization to enhance specific capabilities. Our post-training process illustrates this shift, demonstrating how our data and tuning solutions allow us to finely optimize for distinct skills and use cases.

Here’s a look at the unique specializations that position Athene-V2 models along the Pareto frontier of LLM post-training:

Athene-V2-Chat-72B: A state-of-the-art chat model, matching GPT-4o across multiple benchmarks. It outperforms GPT-4o in chat helpfulness (Arena-Hard), excels in code completion (ranking #2 on bigcode-bench-hard), mathematics (MATH), and handles long log extraction with higher precision (our internal benchmark).

Prior research often relies on a single visual encoder for both tasks, such as Chameleon. However, due to the differing levels of information granularity required by multimodal understanding and generation, this approach can lead to suboptimal performance, particularly in multimodal understanding. To address this issue, we decouple visual encoding into separate pathways, while still leveraging a single, unified transformer architecture for processing. The decoupling not only alleviates the conflict between the visual encoder's roles in understanding and generation, but also enhances the framework's flexibility. For instance, both the multimodal understanding and generation components can independently select their most suitable encoding methods. Experiments show that Janus surpasses previous unified model and matches or exceeds the performance of task-specific models.

Traditional methodologies for RNA structure prediction, including energy-based and learning-based approaches, often

success of diffusion models, in this work, we introduce RNADiffFold, an innovative generative prediction approach
of RNA secondary structures based on multinomial diffusion. We reconceptualize the prediction of contact maps as
akin to pixel-wise segmentation and accordingly train a denoising model to refine the contact maps starting from a
noise-infused state progressively. We also devise a potent conditioning mechanism that harnesses features extracted from
RNA sequences to steer the model toward generating an accurate secondary structure. These features encompass one-hot
encoded sequences, probabilistic maps generated from a pre-trained scoring network, and embeddings and attention
maps derived from RNA-FM. Experimental results on both within- and cross-family datasets demonstrate RNADiffFold’s
competitive performance compared with current state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, RNADiffFold has shown a notable

Many proteins exert their functions through interactions with other proteins, and a significant challenge is designing these interactions effectively. While most efforts have focused on larger, more stable proteins, shorter peptides offer advantages such as lower manufacturing costs, reduced steric hindrance, and the ability to traverse cell membranes when cyclized. However, less structural data is available for peptides and their flexibility makes them harder to design. Here, we present a method to design both novel linear and cyclic peptide binders of varying lengths based solely on a protein target sequence. Our approach does not specify a binding site or the length of the binder, making the procedure completely blind.

To fuse multiple functions into a single capsid sequence, a heuristic algorithm coupled with contrastive learning and reinforcement learning, named function-guided evolution (FE), was introduced to steer further evolution of the high-performing capsid sequences generated by a naive language model toward functions. We then illustrated the evolutionary mechanism of the FE approach for function-guided generation of capsid sequences. Further optimization steers the evolution toward desired functions within a function-guided landscape. Despite the constraint of datasets of only 129 entries, we successfully constructed a model to map AAV capsid sequences to multiple functions of improved viability coupled with central nervous system (CNS) tropism.

With these designs, we managed to pre-train RDT on the largest collection of multi-robot datasets to date and scaled it up to 1.2B parameters, which is the largest diffusion-based foundation model for robotic manipulation. We finally fine-tuned RDT on a self-created multi-task bimanual dataset with over 6K+ episodes to refine its manipulation capabilities. Experiments on real robots demonstrate that RDT significantly outperforms existing methods.

To reduce the complexity, the prevailing approaches employ a cascaded architecture to avoid direct training with full resolution latent. Despite reducing computational demands, the separate optimization of each sub-stage hinders knowledge sharing and sacrifices flexibility. This work introduces a unified pyramidal flow matching algorithm. It reinterprets the original denoising trajectory as a series of pyramid stages, where only the final stage operates at the full resolution, thereby enabling more efficient video generative modeling. Through our sophisticated design, the flows of different pyramid stages can be interlinked to maintain continuity.

Traditional methods for enzyme function prediction or protein binding pocket design often fall short in capturing the dynamic and complex nature of enzyme-substrate interactions, particularly in catalytic processes. To address the challenges, we introduce EnzymeFlow, a generative model that employs flow matching with hierarchical pre-training and enzyme-reaction co-evolution to generate catalytic pockets for specific substrates and catalytic reactions. Additionally, we introduce a large-scale, curated, and validated dataset of enzyme-reaction pairs, specifically designed for the catalytic pocket generation task, comprising a total of 328, 192 pairs. By incorporating evolutionary dynamics and reaction-specific adaptations, EnzymeFlow becomes a powerful model for designing enzyme pockets, which is capable of catalyzing a wide range of biochemical reactions.

We successfully designed binders against a diverse set of challenging targets, including cell-surface receptors, common allergens, de novo designed proteins, and multi-domain nucleases, such as CRISPR-Cas9. We showcase their functional and therapeutic potential by demonstrating that designed binders can reduce IgE binding to birch allergen in patient-derived samples.

Recently, deep learning (DL)-based methods have advanced to the molecular generation of proteins and peptides. Nevertheless, the limited data and the intricate structure of conotoxins constrain the application of deep learning models in the generation of conotoxins. We propose ConoDL, a framework for the generation and prediction of conotoxins, comprising the end-to-end conotoxin generation model (ConoGen) and the conotoxin prediction model (ConoPred). ConoGen employs transfer learning and a large language model (LLM) to tackle the challenges in conotoxin generation.

A comprehensive evaluation of the peptide properties at both sequence and structure levels indicates that the artificial conotoxins generated by ConoDL exhibit a certain degree of similarity to natural conotoxins. Furthermore, ConoDL has generated artificial conotoxins with novel cysteine scaffolds.

When synthesizing engineered proteins, they are commonly translated into DNA and expressed in an organism such as yeast. One difficulty in this process is that the expression rates can be low due to suboptimal codon sequences for expressing a protein in a host organism. We propose CodonMPNN, which generates a codon sequence conditioned on a protein backbone structure and an organism label. If naturally occurring DNA sequences are close to codon optimality, CodonMPNN could learn to generate codon sequences with higher expression yields than heuristic codon choices for generated amino acid sequences. Experiments show that CodonMPNN retains the performance of previous inverse folding approaches and recovers wild-type codons more frequently than baselines.

The Tm is the temperature at which 50% of the protein loses its native structure and activity. Existing methods for predicting Tm have two major limitations: first, they are often trained on redundant proteins, and second, they do not allow users to design proteins with the desired Tm. To address these limitations, we developed a regression method for predicting the Tm value of proteins using 17,312 non-redundant proteins, where no two proteins are more than 40% similar. We used 80% of the data for training and testing; remaining 20% of the data for validation. Initially, we developed a machine learning model using standard features from protein sequences. Our best model, developed using Shannon entropy for all residues, achieved the highest Pearson correlation of 0.80 with an R² of 0.63 between the predicted and actual Tm of proteins on the validation dataset. Next, we fine-tuned large language models (e.g., ProtBert, ProtGPT2, ProtT5) on our training dataset and generated embeddings. These embeddings have been used for developing machine learning models. Our best model, developed using ProtBert embeddings, achieved a maximum correlation of 0.89 with an R² of 0.80 on the validation dataset. Finally, we developed an ensemble method that combines standard protein features and embeddings.

In a recent benchmarking paper, we observed that existing deep-learning tools show a high true positive rate, but may also produce many false positives when confronted with divergent sequences. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Jaeger, a novel deep-learning method designed specifically for identifying bacteriophage genome fragments. Extensive benchmarking on the IMG/VR database and real-world metagenomes reveals Jaeger’s consistent high sensitivity (0.87) and precision (0.92).

The main idea is to use DL models for in-distribution (ID) test sequences to take advantage of their superior ID performances, while relying on physics-based models for OOD sequences to ensure robust predictions. One key ingredient of the pipeline, named MoEFold2D, is automated ID/OOD detection via consensus analysis of an ensemble of DL model predictions without accessing training data during inference. Specifically, motivated by the clustered distribution of known RNA structures, a collection of distinct DL models are trained by iteratively leaving one cluster out. Each DL model hence serves as an expert on all but one cluster in the training data. Consequently, for an ID sequence, all but one DL model makes accurate predictions consistent with one another, while an OOD sequence yields highly inconsistent predictions among all DL models. Consensus analysis of DL predictions categorizes test sequences as ID or OOD. ID sequences are then predicted by averaging the DL models in consensus, and OOD sequences are predicted using physics-based models. Instead of remediating generalization gaps with alternative approaches such as transfer learning and sequence alignment, MoEFold2D circumvents unpredictable ID-OOD gaps and combines the strengths of DL and physics-based models to achieve accurate ID and robust OOD predictions.",,,Open weights (unrestricted),United States of America,,,,,,2025-06-16 13:25,,,,,,Academia,,,,,Open source,"MoEFold2D is open-source software available in the GitHub repository

",,,,,Likely,"Background The binding of transcription factors (TFs) to TF-binding sites plays a vital role in the process of regulating gene expression and evolution. With the development of machine learning and deep learning, some successes have been achieved in predicting transcription factors and binding sites. Then a natural question arises: for a given transcription factor and a binding site, do they bind? This is the main motivation of this work.
Results In this paper, we develop a model BTFBS, which predicts whether the bacterial transcription factors and binding sites combine or not. The model takes both the amino acid sequences of bacterial transcription factors and the nucleotide sequences of binding sites as inputs, and extracts features through convolutional neural network and MultiheadAttention.
For the model inputs, we use two negative sample sampling methods: RS and EE. On the test dataset of RS, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score and MCC of BTFBS are 0.91446, 0.89746, 0.93134, 0.91264 and 0.82946, respectively. And on the test dataset of EE, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score and MCC of BTFBS are 0.87868, 0.89354, 0.86394, 0.87996 and 0.75796, respectively. Meanwhile, our findings indicate that the optimal approach for obtaining negative samples in the context of bacterial research is to utilize the whole genome sequences of the corresponding bacteria, as opposed to the shuffling method.
Conclusions The above results on the test dataset have shown that the proposed BTFBS model has a good performance in predicting the combination of bacterial transcription factors and their binding sites and provides an experimental guide.

Non-natural amino acids (NNAAs) have been used to enhance the peptide properties from binding affinity, plasma stability to permeability. Incorporating novel NNAAs facilitates the design of more effective peptides with improved properties. The generative models used in the field, have focused on navigating the peptide sequence space. The sequence space is formed by combinations of a predefined set of amino acids. However, there is still a need for a tool to explore the peptide landscape beyond this enumerated space to unlock and effectively incorporate de novo design of new amino acids. To thoroughly explore the theoretical chemical space of the peptides, we present PepINVENT, a novel generative AI-based tool as an extension to the small molecule molecular design platform, REINVENT. PepINVENT navigates the vast space of natural and non-natural amino acids to propose valid, novel, and diverse peptide designs. The generative model can serve as a central tool for peptide-related tasks, as it was not trained on peptides with specific properties or topologies. The prior was trained to understand the granularity of peptides and to design amino acids for filling the masked positions within a peptide. PepINVENT coupled with reinforcement learning enables the goal-oriented design of peptides using its chemistry-informed generative capabilities. This study demonstrates PepINVENT's ability to explore the peptide space with unique and novel designs, and its capacity for property optimization in the context of therapeutically relevant peptides. Our tool can be employed for multi-parameter learning objectives, peptidomimetics, lead optimization, and variety of other tasks within the peptide domain.",24.0,,Open weights (unrestricted),"Sweden,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Sweden",,,,,,2025-06-11 17:31,,,,,,"Industry,Academia",,,,,Open source,"Apache 2.0

While the parallel developments in the AI literature focus on foundation models– models that can be effectively tuned to address multiple, different use cases– the developments on the weather and climate side largely focus on single-use cases with particular emphasis on mid-range forecasting. We close this gap by introducing Prithvi WxC, a 2.3 billion parameter foundation model developed using 160 variables from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2). Prithvi WxC employs an encoder-decoder-based architecture, incorporating concepts from various recent transformer models to effectively capture both regional and global dependencies in the input data. The model has been designed to accommodate large token counts to model weather phenomena in different topologies at fine resolutions. Furthermore, it is trained with a mixed objective that combines the paradigms of masked reconstruction with forecasting. We test the model on a set of challenging downstream tasks namely: Autoregressive rollout forecasting, Downscaling, Gravity wave flux parameterization, and Extreme events estimation.

In this study, we present pKALM, a novel deep learning-based method for high-throughput protein pKa prediction. pKALM uses a protein language model (PLM) to capture the complex sequence-structure relationship of proteins. While traditionally considered a structure-based problem, our results show that a PLM pre-trained on large-scale protein sequence databases can effectively learn this relationship and achieve state-of-the-art performance. pKALM accurately predicts the pKa values of six residues (Asp, Glu, His, Lys, Cys, and Tyr) and two termini with high precision and efficiency. It excels at predicting both exposed and buried residues, which often deviate from standard pKa values measured in solvent. We demonstrate a novel finding that predicted protein isoelectric points (pI) can be used to improve the accuracy of pKa prediction. High-throughput pKa prediction of the human proteome using pKALM achieves a speed of 4,965 pKa predictions per second, which is several orders of magnitude faster than existing state-of-the-art methods. The case studies illustrate the efficacy of pKALM in estimating pKa values and the constraints of the method. pKALM will thus be a valuable tool for researchers in the fields of biochemistry, biophysics, and drug design.",130.0,,,Japan,ESM2-35M,,,2.0,,2025-05-01 10:42,,,,,,Academia,,,,,,,Academia,,,,1772.983930669006,Operation counting,,,,

Existing multi-modal LLMs usually standardize these diverse visual inputs to a fixed resolution for visual encoders and yield similar numbers of tokens for LLMs. This approach is non-optimal for multimodal understanding and inefficient for processing inputs with long and short visual contents. To solve the problem, we propose Oryx, a unified multimodal architecture for the spatial-temporal understanding of images, videos, and multi-view 3D scenes. Oryx offers an on-demand solution to seamlessly and efficiently process visual inputs with arbitrary spatial sizes and temporal lengths through two core innovations: 1) a pre-trained OryxViT model that can encode images at any resolution into LLM-friendly visual representations; 2) a dynamic compressor module that supports 1x to 16x compression on visual tokens by request. These design features enable Oryx to accommodate extremely long visual contexts, such as videos, with lower resolution and high compression while maintaining high recognition precision for tasks like document understanding with native resolution and no compression. Beyond the architectural improvements, enhanced data curation and specialized training on long-context retrieval and spatial-aware data help Oryx achieve strong capabilities in image, video, and 3D multimodal understanding simultaneously",,,Open weights (unrestricted),"China,China,Singapore",Yi-1.5-34B,,,64.0,,2025-06-02 13:54,,,,128.0,,"Academia,Industry,Academia",,,,,Open source,"Apache 2.0

In this work, we formulate proteins and molecules as unified biotokens, and present AtomFlow, a novel deep generative model under the flow-matching framework for the design of ligand-binding proteins from the 2D target molecular graph alone. Operating on representative atoms of biotokens, AtomFlow captures the flexibility of ligands and generates ligand conformations and protein backbone structures iteratively. We consider the multi-scale nature of biotokens and demonstrate that AtomFlow can be effectively trained on a subset of structures from the Protein Data Bank, by matching flow vector field using an SE(3) equivariant structure prediction network. Experimental results show that our method can generate high fidelity ligand-binding proteins and achieve performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model RFDiffusionAA, while not requiring bound ligand structures.

As long-term passive acoustic monitoring capabilities have grown more technologically sophisticated, automatic animal species identification tools built on large datasets from these recorded soundscapes have become an increasingly vital tool for conservation and ecological research. While models such as Google Perch have emerged that can classify thousands of bird vocalizations, similar models that can classify vocalizations from several whale species at once have proven more challenging to develop.

The acoustic range of whale species is incredibly broad, ranging from as low as 10 Hz for blue whales to above 120kHz for odontocetes (toothed whales), and recordings also vary dramatically by location and with time, which can make model development difficult. Additionally, researchers often don’t know what types of vocalizations are made by some especially elusive whale species, which complicates identifying those animals in the soundscapes. This is illustrated in the decades-old mystery surrounding a sound, called a “Biotwang”, that was first recorded almost a decade ago in the depths of the Mariana Trench. The sound has a ""metallic"" or ""chime-like"" quality, quite unlike the tonal moans more typical of whale vocalizations. In a recent paper, our collaborators at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) determined that the Biotwang sound is uniquely produced by the elusive Bryde’s whales (pronounced ""broodus"").

Today we are delighted to share Google’s latest whale bioacoustics model, which can identify eight distinct species, as well as multiple calls for two of those species. Following on our collaborator’s discovery connecting Biotwangs to the Bryde’s whale and in the same paper, we expanded the model to include Biotwangs and used it to label more than 200,000 hours of underwater recordings. Here we describe the model and discuss some of the new insights into the ecology of whale species it is helping researchers to unlock. The model is now available for download via Kaggle Models.

This multi-label audio classification model, when applied to a 5-second context window of 24kHz mono audio, outputs 12 scores representing confidence that the audio contains a whale vocalization from a particular species (7 classes) or of a particular type (5 classes).",,,Open weights (non-commercial),"Multinational,United States of America,Canada,Switzerland,United States of America,United States of America",,,,,,2025-05-01 10:42,,,,,,"Industry,Government,Academia",,,,,Open source,"""This model has been developed as part of the AI for Nature and Society program at Google.

Unlike popular diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion), OmniGen no longer requires additional modules such as ControlNet or IP-Adapter to process diverse control conditions. OmniGenis characterized by the following features: 1) Unification: OmniGen not only demonstrates text-to-image generation capabilities but also inherently supports other downstream tasks, such as image editing, subject-driven generation, and visual-conditional generation. Additionally, OmniGen can handle classical computer vision tasks by transforming them into image generation tasks, such as edge detection and human pose recognition. 2) Simplicity: The architecture of OmniGen is highly simplified, eliminating the need for additional text encoders. Moreover, it is more user-friendly compared to existing diffusion models, enabling complex tasks to be accomplished through instructions without the need for extra preprocessing steps (e.g., human pose estimation), thereby significantly simplifying the workflow of image generation. 3) Knowledge Transfer: Through learning in a unified format, OmniGen effectively transfers knowledge across different tasks, manages unseen tasks and domains, and exhibits novel capabilities. We also explore the model's reasoning capabilities and potential applications of chain-of-thought mechanism.

We introduce Localized Geometric Generation (LEGO), a novel approach that treats tetrahedrons within 3D molecular structures as fundamental building blocks, leveraging their geometric simplicity and widespread presence across chemical functional patterns. Inspired by masked modeling, LEGO perturbs tetrahedral local structures and learns to reconstruct them in a self-supervised manner.

As the flagship model of the Solar LLM series, Solar Pro features 22 billion parameters, more than double the size of its predecessor, Solar Mini. Despite its increased size, Solar Pro is optimized to run efficiently on a single GPU, thanks to Upstage's proprietary Depth-Up Scaling (DUS) method and advanced data recipe. This innovation enables Solar Pro to deliver state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing model size—an essential advantage in the face of rising GPU costs and supply constraints in the AI landscape.

Solar Pro's advanced capabilities have translated to impressive gains in key LLM benchmarks, with an average improvement of 51% compared to Solar Mini. It achieved an accuracy score of 52.11 on the MMLU Pro benchmark, which measures multi-disciplinary language understanding and reasoning across 14 domains.

Following this recipe, we propose MolPhenix, a molecular phenomics model. MolPhenix leverages a pre-trained phenomics model to demonstrate significant performance gains across perturbation concentrations, molecular scaffolds, and activity thresholds. In particular, we demonstrate an 8.1x improvement in zero shot molecular retrieval of active molecules over the previous state-of-the-art, reaching 77.33% in top-1% accuracy. These results open the door for machine learning to be applied in virtual phenomics screening, which can significantly benefit drug discovery applications.",100.0,,,"Canada,Canada,Canada,Canada,Canada,Canada",,,,1.0,,2025-05-01 10:42,,,,,,"Industry,Academia,Academia,Academia,Academia,Academia",,,,,,,"Industry,Academia,Academia,Academia,Academia,Academia",,,,433.0498938750792,Hardware,,,,

The design of these CDRs determines the antibody's affinity and specificity towards its target. Generative models, particularly denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), have shown potential to advance the structure-based design of CDR regions. However, only a limited dataset of bound antibody-antigen structures is available, and generalization to out-of-distribution interfaces remains a challenge. Physics based force-fields, which approximate atomic interactions, offer a coarse but universal source of information to better mold designs to target interfaces. Integrating this foundational information into diffusion models is, therefore, highly desirable. Here, we propose a novel approach to enhance the sampling process of diffusion models by integrating force field energy-based feedback. Our model, DiffForce, employs forces to guide the diffusion sampling process, effectively blending the two distributions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method guides the model to sample CDRs with lower energy, enhancing both the structure and sequence of the generated antibodies.",,,,"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,China,Australia",,,,,,2025-05-01 10:42,,,,,,"Academia,Academia,Academia",,,,,,,"Academia,Academia,Academia",,,,,,,,,

In their basic form, however, they lack mechanisms to optimize for specific properties, such as binding affinity to an antigen. In contrast, the class of offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods has demonstrated strong performance in navigating large search spaces, including scenarios where frequent real-world interaction, such as interaction with a wet lab, is impractical.

However, DEL screening faces a significant challenge: noise arising from nonspecific interactions within complex biological systems. Neural networks trained on DEL libraries have been employed to extract compound features, aiming to denoise the data and uncover potential binders to the desired therapeutic target. Nevertheless, the inherent structure of DEL, constrained by the limited diversity of building blocks, impacts the performance of compound encoders. Moreover, existing methods only capture compound features at a single level, further limiting the effectiveness of the denoising strategy. To mitigate these issues, we propose a Multimodal Pretraining DEL-Fusion model (MPDF) that enhances encoder capabilities through pretraining and integrates compound features across various scales. We develop pretraining tasks applying contrastive objectives between different compound representations and their text descriptions, enhancing the compound encoders' ability to acquire generic features. Furthermore, we propose a novel DEL-fusion framework that amalgamates compound information at the atomic, submolecular, and molecular levels, as captured by various compound encoders. The synergy of these innovations equips MPDF with enriched, multi-scale features, enabling comprehensive downstream denoising. Evaluated on three DEL datasets, MPDF demonstrates superior performance in data processing and analysis for validation tasks.

Accurate prediction of protein variant effects requires a thorough understanding of protein sequence, structure, and function. Deep learning methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in guiding protein modification for improved functionality. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on protein sequences, which face challenges in efficiently encoding the geometric aspects of amino acids’ local environment and often fall short in capturing crucial details related to protein folding stability, internal molecular interactions, and bio-functions. Furthermore, there lacks a fundamental evaluation for developed methods in predicting protein thermostability, although it is a key physical property that is frequently investigated in practice. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel pre-training framework that integrates sequential and geometric encoders for protein primary and tertiary structures. This framework guides mutation directions toward desired traits by simulating natural selection on wild-type proteins and evaluates variant effects based on their fitness to perform specific functions. We assess the proposed approach using three benchmarks comprising over 300 deep mutational scanning assays.

While conventional computational methods such as molecular docking have facilitated the discovery of potential hit compounds, the development of genome-wide virtual screening against the expansive chemical space remains a formidable challenge. Here we introduce DrugCLIP, a novel framework that combines contrastive learning and dense retrieval to achieve rapid and accurate virtual screening. Compared to traditional docking methods, DrugCLIP improves the speed of virtual screening by several orders of magnitude. In terms of performance, DrugCLIP not only surpasses docking and other deep learning-based methods across two standard benchmark datasets but also demonstrates high efficacy in wet-lab experiments. Specifically, DrugCLIP successfully identified agonists with < 100 nM affinities for 5HT2AR, a key target in psychiatric diseases. For another target NET, whose structure is newly solved and not included in the training set, our method achieved a hit rate of 15%, with 12 diverse molecules exhibiting affinities better than Bupropion. Additionally, two chemically novel inhibitors were validated by structure determination with Cryo-EM. Building on this foundation, we present the results of a pioneering trillion-scale genome-wide virtual screening, encompassing approximately 10,000 AlphaFold2 predicted proteins within the human genome and 500 million molecules from the ZINC and Enamine REAL database.

Current CCI analysis methods face several limitations, including subjection to the number of measured ligand-receptor genes in image-based spatial transcriptomics, limited graph encoding power, inadequate use of spatial information, and low interpretability. Here, we present GITIII, an interpretable self-supervised graph transformerbased language model that treats cells as words (nodes) and their cell neighborhood as a sentence to explore the communications among cells. Enhanced by multilayer perceptron-based distance scaler, physics-informed attention mechanism, and a state-of-the-art, expressive, and lightweight graph transformer model, GITIII infers CCI by investigating how the state of a cell is influenced by the spatial organization, ligand expression, cell types and states of neighboring cells. With its interpretable architecture, GITIII can be used to understand how the sender cell influences target genes in the receiver cell, visualize the spatial pattern and utility of CCI, identify significant CCI networks, perform CCI-informed cell subtyping, and compare CCI strength between disease groups. Applications to four ST datasets from several species, organs, and platforms, GITIII effectively identified and quantitatively interpreted key CCI patterns driving within-sample heterogeneity and disease progression, thus improving our understanding of brain structures, tumor microenvironments, and the interplay among different cell types responding to neighboring CCIs.",50.0,,,,,,,,,2025-05-01 10:42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recent emerging pre-trained language models trained on
massive unsupervised sequences of protein and RNA have
shown strong representation ability for various in-domain
downstream tasks, including binding site prediction. However, applying different-domain language models collaboratively for complex-level tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose CoPRA to bridge pre-trained language models from different biological domains via Complex structure
for Protein-RNA binding Affinity prediction. We demonstrate
for the first time that cross-biological modal language models can collaborate to improve binding affinity prediction. We
propose a Co-Former to combine the cross-modal sequence
and structure information and a bi-scope pre-training strategy for improving Co-Former’s interaction understanding.
Meanwhile, we build the largest protein-RNA binding affinity
dataset PRA310 for performance evaluation. We also test our
model on a public dataset for mutation effect prediction. CoPRA reaches state-of-the-art performance on all the datasets.

We propose a novel, easy-to-use approach to achieving high-quality representations that lead to adversarial robustness through the use of multi-resolution input representations and dynamic self-ensembling of intermediate layer predictions. We demonstrate that intermediate layer predictions exhibit inherent robustness to adversarial attacks crafted to fool the full classifier, and propose a robust aggregation mechanism based on Vickrey auction that we call \textit{CrossMax} to dynamically ensemble them. By combining multi-resolution inputs and robust ensembling, we achieve significant adversarial robustness on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets without any adversarial training or extra data, reaching an adversarial accuracy of ≈72% (CIFAR-10) and ≈48% (CIFAR-100) on the RobustBench AutoAttack suite (L∞=8/255) with a finetuned ImageNet-pretrained ResNet152. This represents a result comparable with the top three models on CIFAR-10 and a +5 % gain compared to the best current dedicated approach on CIFAR-100. Adding simple adversarial training on top, we get ≈78% on CIFAR-10 and ≈51% on CIFAR-100, improving SOTA by 5 % and 9 % respectively and seeing greater gains on the harder dataset. We validate our approach through extensive experiments and provide insights into the interplay between adversarial robustness, and the hierarchical nature of deep representations. We show that simple gradient-based attacks against our model lead to human-interpretable images of the target classes as well as interpretable image changes. As a byproduct, using our multi-resolution prior, we turn pre-trained classifiers and CLIP models into controllable image generators and develop successful transferable attacks on large vision language models.",13.0,,Unreleased,"United States of America,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Multinational,Canada,France",ResNet-152 (ImageNet),957902400000000000,"6ND = 6 FLOP / token / parameter * 60200000 parameters* 204000000 tokens * 13 epochs = 9.579024e+17 FLOP

For these problems, we have developed a universal RNA sequence generation model based on flow matching, namely RNACG. RNACG can accommodate various conditional inputs and is portable, enabling users to customize the encoding network for conditional inputs as per their requirements and integrate it into the generation network. We evaluated RNACG in RNA 3D structure inverse folding, 2D structure inverse folding, family-specific sequence generation, and 5'UTR translation efficiency prediction. RNACG attains superior or competitive performance on these tasks compared with other methods. RNACG exhibits extensive applicability in sequence generation and property prediction tasks, providing a novel approach to RNA sequence design and potential methods for simulation experiments with large-scale RNA sequence data.",,,,China,,,,,,2025-05-01 10:42,,,,,,Academia,,,,,,,Academia,,,,,,,,,

",Industry,,MFU ranges between 0.38 and 0.43 depending on the specific parallelism used; I assume the geometric mean: sqrt(0.38 * 0.43) = 0.4042,BF16,22622532.159299143,"Reported,Operation counting",meta-llama,9.4e+22,"Section 4 gives detail about the post-training process. They do 6 rounds of post-training, using the model from the previous iteration in each successive round. In each round, they fine-tune a copy of the language model into a reward model (RM) using preference data, then use the reward model to do rejection sampling on human annotation prompts. Next they do supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the rejection sampled data along with some synthetic data (8.5k to 9k steps per round). Next, they do Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) over the most recent generation of preference data. Finally, they do model averaging over experiments using different samples of data or hyperparameters in each of the RM, SFT, and DPO steps. 

We can get a very rough estimate of total post-training compute:
- RM section doesn't give any detail about batch size or training length. In Llama 2, they trained the RM for one epoch over their 1.7B tokens of preference data. We aren't told how many examples they have in Llama 3, though we see that examples are somewhat longer, apparently because they contain more turns on average. Assuming preference data scaled up by a similar amount to pre-training data (2T to 15T tokens from Llama 2 to 3), that suggests around 1.7B * 15T / 2T = 12.75B tokens, which corresponds to 6 * 12.75B * 405B = 3.098e22 FLOPs, if they used the 405b variant for their reward model.
- SFT uses 8.5k-9k steps in each round. Batch size is not given here, but in Llama 2 they used batches of 64 sequences of 4096 = 262,144 tokens. Assuming they scaled up SFT batches by a similar ratio as they did pretraining (4M in Llama 2 -> 16M for most of Llama 3 pretraining), Llama 3's SFT would have used around 1M tokens per batch. That suggests 6 * 9k * 1M * 405B = 2.187e22 FLOP per round of SFT. 
- DPO section gives no detail about quantity of examples or training length. Llama 2 used PPO for 200-400 iterations per model; each iteration was a batch of 512 examples, and took ~330 seconds. Our current estimate is that Llama 2-70B used 1000 A100s, which would suggest 330 * 3.12e14 * 1000 = 4.118e22 FLOP. DPO uses less compute, but presumably they've also scaled up their data here; without further info let's speculate these roughly cancel out.
So total fine-tuning compute is about 3.1e22 + 2.2e22 + 4.1e22 = 9.4E22 FLOPs",3

However, existing methods often struggle with generating high-fidelity and detail-consistent results. While diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion series, have shown their capability in creating high-quality and photorealistic images, they encounter formidable challenges in conditional generation scenarios like VTON. Specifically, these models struggle to maintain a balance between control and consistency when generating images for virtual clothing trials. OutfitAnyone addresses these limitations by leveraging a two-stream conditional diffusion model, enabling it to adeptly handle garment deformation for more lifelike results. It distinguishes itself with scalability-modulating factors such as pose, body shape and broad applicability, extending from anime to in-the-wild images.

In contrast to complex hierarchical tags, we have simplified the pre-training process by utilizing natural language prompts for different data and tasks, and have further expanded the data volume. We have boosted the instruction-following capability of Qwen2-Audio and implemented two distinct audio interaction modes for voice chat and audio analysis. In the voice chat mode, users can freely engage in voice interactions with Qwen2-Audio without text input. In the audio analysis mode, users could provide audio and text instructions for analysis during the interaction. Note that we do not use any system prompts to switch between voice chat and audio analysis modes. Qwen2-Audio is capable of intelligently comprehending the content within audio and following voice commands to respond appropriately. For instance, in an audio segment that simultaneously contains sounds, multi-speaker conversations, and a voice command, Qwen2-Audio can directly understand the command and provide an interpretation and response to the audio. Additionally, DPO has optimized the model's performance in terms of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. According to the evaluation results from AIR-Bench, Qwen2-Audio outperformed previous SOTAs, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, in tests focused on audio-centric instruction-following capabilities.

The alignment enables free and bidirectional mappings between sequences and structures by utilising the flexible RNA modelling paradigm that supports versatile input and output modalities, i.e., sequence and/or structure as input/output. We implement RNA design and zero-shot secondary structure prediction as case studies to evaluate the Seq2Str and Str2Seq mapping capacity of OmniGenome. Results on the EternaV2 benchmark show that OmniGenome solved 74% of puzzles, whereas existing FMs only solved up to 3% of the puzzles due to the oversight of sequence-structure alignment.

Here, we report PARM, a cell-type specific deep learning model trained on specially designed massively parallel reporter assays that query human promoter sequences. PARM requires ∼1,000 times less computational power than state-of-the-art technology, and reliably predicts autonomous promoter activity throughout the genome from DNA sequence alone, in multiple cell types. PARM can even design purely synthetic strong promoters. We leveraged PARM to systematically identify binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) that are likely to contribute to the activity of each natural human promoter. We uncovered and experimentally confirmed striking positional preferences of TFs that differ between activating and repressive regulatory functions, as well as a complex grammar of motif-motif interactions. For example, many, but not all, TFs act as repressors when their binding motif is located near or just downstream of the transcription start site.

Despite the advances in deep learning and scientific large language models (LLMs) for protein research, current methodologies predominantly focus on limited specialized tasks – often predicting one protein modality from another. These approaches restrict the understanding and generation of multimodal protein data. In contrast, large multimodal models have demonstrated potential capabilities in generating any-to-any content like text, images, and videos, thus enriching user interactions across various domains. Integrating these multimodal model technologies into protein research offers significant promise by potentially transforming how proteins are studied. To this end, we introduce HelixProtX, a system built upon the large multimodal model, aiming to offer a comprehensive solution to protein research by supporting any-to-any protein modality generation. Unlike existing methods, it allows for the transformation of any input protein modality into any desired protein modality. The experimental results affirm the advanced capabilities of HelixProtX, not only in generating functional descriptions from amino acid sequences but also in executing critical tasks such as designing protein sequences and structures from textual descriptions.

In this study, we propose an interpretable and scalable inference framework, DeepTX, that leverages deep learning methods to connect mechanistic models and scRNA-seq data, thereby revealing genome-wide transcriptional burst kinetics. This framework enables rapid and accurate solutions to transcription models and the inference of transcriptional burst kinetics from scRNA-seq data. Applying this framework to several scRNA-seq datasets of DNA-damaging drug treatments, we observed that fluctuations in transcriptional bursting induced by different drugs could lead to distinct fate decisions: IdU treatment induces differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells by increasing the burst size of gene expression, while 5FU treatment with low and high dose increases the burst frequency of gene expression to induce cell apoptosis and survival in human colon cancer cells.

As multiple PPI networks exist for the same set of proteins that capture properties from different aspects, it is a challenging task to effectively utilize these heterogeneous networks. Recently, several deep learning models have combined PPI networks from all evidence, or concatenated all graph embeddings for protein function prediction. However, the lack of a judicious selection procedure prevents the effective harness of information from different PPI networks, as these networks vary in densities, structures, and noise levels. Consequently, combining protein features indiscriminately could increase the noise level, leading to decreased model performance.

Results We develop DualNetGO, a dual network model comprised of a classifier and a selector, to predict protein functions by effectively selecting features from different sources including graph embeddings of PPI networks, protein domain and subcellular location information. Evaluation of DualNetGO on human and mouse datasets in comparison with other network-based models show at least 4.5%, 6.2% and 14.2% improvement on Fmax in BP, MF and CC Gene Ontology categories respectively for human, and 3.3%, 10.6% and 7.7% improvement on Fmax for mouse. We demonstrate the generalization capability of our model by training and testing on the CAFA3 data, and show its versatility by incorporating Esm2 embeddings. We further show that our model is insensitive to the choice of graph embedding method and is time- and memory-saving. These results demonstrate that combining a subset of features including PPI networks and protein attributes selected by our model is more effective in utilizing PPI network information than only using one kind of or concatenating graph embeddings from all kinds of PPI networks.

In particular, diffusion-based approaches to SBDD have shown great promise. We present a technique which expands on this diffusion approach in two crucial ways. First, we address the size disparity between the drug molecule and the target/receptor, which makes learning more challenging and inference slower. We do so through the notion of a Virtual Receptor, which is a compressed version of the receptor; it is learned so as to preserve key aspects of the structural information of the original receptor, while respecting the relevant group equivariance. Second, we incorporate a protein language embedding used originally in the context of protein folding. We experimentally demonstrate the contributions of both the virtual receptors and the protein embeddings: in practice, they lead to both better performance, as well as significantly faster computations.",1000.0,,,United States of America,,,,,,2025-05-01 10:42,,,,,,Industry,,,,,,,Industry,,,,,,,,,

Several methods use machine learning for SBDD to generate these ligands in 3D space, conditioned on the structure of a desired protein pocket. Recently, diffusion models have shown success here by modeling the underlying distributions of atomic positions and types. While these methods are effective in considering the structural details of the protein pocket, they often fail to explicitly consider the binding affinity. Binding affinity characterizes how tightly the ligand binds to the protein pocket, and is measured by the change in free energy associated with the binding process. It is one of the most crucial metrics for benchmarking the effectiveness of the interaction between a ligand and protein pocket. To address this, we propose BADGER: Binding Affinity Diffusion Guidance with Enhanced Refinement. BADGER is a general guidance method to steer the diffusion sampling process towards improved protein-ligand binding, allowing us to adjust the distribution of the binding affinity between ligands and proteins. Our method is enabled by using a neural network (NN) to model the energy function, which is commonly approximated by AutoDock Vina (ADV). ADV’s energy function is non-differentiable, and estimates the affinity based on the interactions between a ligand and target protein receptor. By using a NN as a differentiable energy function proxy, we utilize the gradient of our learned energy function as a guidance method on top of any trained diffusion model. We show that our method improves the binding affinity of generated ligands to their protein receptors by up to 60%, significantly surpassing previous machine learning methods. We also show that our guidance method is flexible and can be easily applied to other diffusion-based SBDD frameworks.",20.0,,,"United States of America,United States of America",,,,1.0,,2025-05-01 10:42,,,,,,"Industry,Academia",,,,,,,"Industry,Academia",,,,,,,,,

While stronger language models can enhance multimodal capabilities, the design choices for vision components are often insufficiently explored and disconnected from visual representation learning research. This gap hinders accurate sensory grounding in real-world scenarios. Our study uses LLMs and visual instruction tuning as an interface to evaluate various visual representations, offering new insights into different models and architectures -- self-supervised, strongly supervised, or combinations thereof -- based on experiments with over 20 vision encoders. We critically examine existing MLLM benchmarks, address the difficulties involved in consolidating and interpreting results from various tasks, and introduce a new vision-centric benchmark, CV-Bench. To further improve visual grounding, we propose the Spatial Vision Aggregator (SVA), a dynamic and spatially-aware connector that integrates high-resolution vision features with LLMs while reducing the number of tokens. Additionally, we discuss the curation of high-quality visual instruction-tuning data from publicly available sources, emphasizing the importance of data source balancing and distribution ratio. Collectively, Cambrian-1 not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also serves as a comprehensive, open cookbook for instruction-tuned MLLMs. We provide model weights, code, supporting tools, datasets, and detailed instruction-tuning and evaluation recipes.

6 * 340B * 9T = 1.8E25

alternatively, can do a hardware estimate with a few extra steps:

According to the technical report, Nemotron-4 340B was trained using up to 6144 H100 GPUs. Helpfully, they also report the model FLOP utilization (MFU), which was 41-42% (Table 2). This is the ratio of the actual output of their GPUs, in FLOP used for training, relative to their theoretical max of 989 teraFLOP/s per GPU. 
Unfortunately, the report omits the last ingredient, which is the duration of the training run. However, in Table 2 they report some relevant data that we can use to infer the training time. 
Nemotron-4 was trained in several stages, but the largest stage used all 6144 GPUs with a batch size of 2304 and an iteration time (time per batch) of 8.0 seconds. This stage involved 7.6T tokens, so it makes up the majority of training. 
A batch size of 2304 means that each batch consists of 2304 sequences, and they report that the sequence length used for training was 4096 tokens. This means that each batch contained 4096 * 2304 = 9,437,184 tokens. 
So, during this stage, it took 8 seconds to train the model on 9.4m tokens. Extrapolating to the entire 9T token dataset, this implies the training run would have taken 7,659,574 seconds, or 89 days. (it actually took longer because they didn't use all their GPUs for the whole run) 
Multiplying 7,659,574 seconds by 41% MFU, 989 peak teraFLOP/s for each H100, and 6144 H100s, we get ~1.9e25 FLOP. This is very close to our first estimate.

This renders off-the-shelf VLMs sub-optimal for decision-making tasks such as in-the-wild device control through graphical user interfaces (GUIs). While training with static demonstrations has shown some promise, we show that such methods fall short for controlling real GUIs due to their failure to deal with real-world stochasticity and non-stationarity not captured in static observational data. This paper introduces a novel autonomous RL approach, called DigiRL, for training in-the-wild device control agents through fine-tuning a pre-trained VLM in two stages: offline RL to initialize the model, followed by offline-to-online RL. To do this, we build a scalable and parallelizable Android learning environment equipped with a VLM-based evaluator and develop a simple yet effective RL approach for learning in this domain. Our approach runs advantage-weighted RL with advantage estimators enhanced to account for stochasticity along with an automatic curriculum for deriving maximal learning signal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DigiRL using the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) dataset, where our 1.3B VLM trained with RL achieves a 49.5% absolute improvement -- from 17.7 to 67.2% success rate -- over supervised fine-tuning with static human demonstration data.

Yet, widespread adoption of VLAs for robotics has been challenging as 1) existing VLAs are largely closed and inaccessible to the public, and 2) prior work fails to explore methods for efficiently fine-tuning VLAs for new tasks, a key component for adoption. Addressing these challenges, we introduce OpenVLA, a 7B-parameter open-source VLA trained on a diverse collection of 970k real-world robot demonstrations. OpenVLA builds on a Llama 2 language model combined with a visual encoder that fuses pretrained features from DINOv2 and SigLIP. As a product of the added data diversity and new model components, OpenVLA demonstrates strong results for generalist manipulation, outperforming closed models such as RT-2-X (55B) by 16.5% in absolute task success rate across 29 tasks and multiple robot embodiments, with 7x fewer parameters. We further show that we can effectively fine-tune OpenVLA for new settings, with especially strong generalization results in multi-task environments involving multiple objects and strong language grounding abilities, and outperform expressive from-scratch imitation learning methods such as Diffusion Policy by 20.4%. We also explore compute efficiency; as a separate contribution, we show that OpenVLA can be fine-tuned on consumer GPUs via modern low-rank adaptation methods and served efficiently via quantization without a hit to downstream success rate.

In this paper, we leverage the power of diffusion models and propose a novel framework tailored for character animation. To preserve consistency of intricate appearance features from reference image, we design ReferenceNet to merge detail features via spatial attention. To ensure controllability and continuity, we introduce an efficient pose guider to direct character's movements and employ an effective temporal modeling approach to ensure smooth inter-frame transitions between video frames.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average.

Tokenization, which transforms images into latent representations, reduces computational demands compared to directly processing pixels and enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of the generation process. Prior methods, such as VQGAN, typically utilize 2D latent grids with fixed downsampling factors. However, these 2D tokenizations face challenges in managing the inherent redundancies present in images, where adjacent regions frequently display similarities. To overcome this issue, we introduce Transformer-based 1-Dimensional Tokenizer (TiTok), an innovative approach that tokenizes images into 1D latent sequences. TiTok provides a more compact latent representation, yielding substantially more efficient and effective representations than conventional techniques. For example, a 256 x 256 x 3 image can be reduced to just 32 discrete tokens, a significant reduction from the 256 or 1024 tokens obtained by prior methods. Despite its compact nature, TiTok achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, using the same generator framework, TiTok attains 1.97 gFID, outperforming MaskGIT baseline significantly by 4.21 at ImageNet 256 x 256 benchmark. The advantages of TiTok become even more significant when it comes to higher resolution. At ImageNet 512 x 512 benchmark, TiTok not only outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion model DiT-XL/2 (gFID 2.74 vs. 3.04), but also reduces the image tokens by 64x, leading to 410x faster generation process.

FoldFlow-2 presents substantial new architectural features over the previous FoldFlow family of models including a protein large language model to encode sequence, a new multi-modal fusion trunk that combines structure and sequence representations, and a geometric transformer based decoder. To increase diversity and novelty of generated samples -- crucial for de-novo drug design -- we train FoldFlow-2 at scale on a new dataset that is an order of magnitude larger than PDB datasets of prior works, containing both known proteins in PDB and high-quality synthetic structures achieved through filtering. We further demonstrate the ability to align FoldFlow-2 to arbitrary rewards, e.g. increasing secondary structures diversity, by introducing a Reinforced Finetuning (ReFT) objective. We empirically observe that FoldFlow-2 outperforms previous state-of-the-art protein structure-based generative models, improving over RFDiffusion in terms of unconditional generation across all metrics including designability, diversity, and novelty across all protein lengths, as well as exhibiting generalization on the task of equilibrium conformation sampling. Finally, we demonstrate that a fine-tuned FoldFlow-2 makes progress on challenging conditional design tasks such as designing scaffolds for the VHH nanobody.",,,Open weights (non-commercial),"Canada,Canada,Canada,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",ESM2-650M,,,2.0,,2025-06-16 11:06,,,,,,"Industry,Academia,Academia,Academia",,,,,Open (non-commercial),"CC NC 4.0

In this work, we introduce the NV-Embed model with a variety of architectural designs and training procedures to significantly enhance the performance of LLM as a versatile embedding model, while maintaining its simplicity and reproducibility. For model architecture, we propose a latent attention layer to obtain pooled embeddings, which consistently improves retrieval and downstream task accuracy compared to mean pooling or using the last <EOS> token embedding from LLMs. To enhance representation learning, we remove the causal attention mask of LLMs during contrastive training. For model training, we introduce a two-stage contrastive instruction-tuning method. It first applies contrastive training with instructions on retrieval datasets, utilizing in-batch negatives and curated hard negative examples. At stage-2, it blends various non-retrieval datasets into instruction tuning, which not only enhances non-retrieval task accuracy but also improves retrieval performance. Combining these techniques, our NV-Embed model, using only publicly available data, has achieved a record-high score of 69.32, ranking No. 1 on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) (as of May 24, 2024), with 56 tasks, encompassing retrieval, reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual similarity tasks.

This method transforms the continuous, complex space of protein structures into a manageable, discrete format with a codebook ranging from 4096 to 64000 tokens, achieving high-fidelity reconstructions with backbone root mean square deviations (RMSD) of approximately 1-5 Å.

This report primarily focuses on the GLM-4 language series, which includes GLM-4, GLM-4-Air, and GLM-4-9B. They represent our most capable models that are trained with all the insights and lessons gained from the preceding three generations of ChatGLM. To date, the GLM-4 models are pre-trained on ten trillions of tokens mostly in Chinese and English, along with a small set of corpus from 24 languages, and aligned primarily for Chinese and English usage. The high-quality alignment is achieved via a multi-stage post-training process, which involves supervised fine-tuning and learning from human feedback. Evaluations show that GLM-4 1) closely rivals or outperforms GPT-4 in terms of general metrics such as MMLU, GSM8K, MATH, BBH, GPQA, and HumanEval, 2) gets close to GPT-4-Turbo in instruction following as measured by IFEval, 3) matches GPT-4 Turbo (128K) and Claude 3 for long context tasks, and 4) outperforms GPT-4 in Chinese alignments as measured by AlignBench. The GLM-4 All Tools model is further aligned to understand user intent and autonomously decide when and which tool(s) touse -- including web browser, Python interpreter, text-to-image model, and user-defined functions -- to effectively complete complex tasks. In practical applications, it matches and even surpasses GPT-4 All Tools in tasks like accessing online information via web browsing and solving math problems using Python interpreter. Over the course, we have open-sourced a series of models, including ChatGLM-6B (three generations), GLM-4-9B (128K, 1M), GLM-4V-9B, WebGLM, and CodeGeeX, attracting over 10 million downloads on Hugging face in the year 2023 alone.

",Google TPU v4,,Confident,"Large policies pretrained on diverse robot datasets have the potential to transform robotic learning: instead of training new policies from scratch, such generalist robot policies may be finetuned with only a little in-domain data, yet generalize broadly. However, to be widely applicable across a range of robotic learning scenarios, environments, and tasks, such policies need to handle diverse sensors and action spaces, accommodate a variety of commonly used robotic platforms, and finetune readily and efficiently to new domains. In this work, we aim to lay the groundwork for developing open-source, widely applicable, generalist policies for robotic manipulation. As a first step, we introduce Octo, a large transformer-based policy trained on 800k trajectories from the Open X-Embodiment dataset, the largest robot manipulation dataset to date. It can be instructed via language commands or goal images and can be effectively finetuned to robot setups with new sensory inputs and action spaces within a few hours on standard consumer GPUs. In experiments across 9 robotic platforms, we demonstrate that Octo serves as a versatile policy initialization that can be effectively finetuned to new observation and action spaces.

However, while protein function is intricately tied to structure, most existing PLMs do not incorporate protein structure information. To address this issue, we introduce ProSST, a Transformer-based protein language model that seamlessly integrates both protein sequences and structures. ProSST incorporates a structure quantization module and a Transformer architecture with disentangled attention. The structure quantization module translates a 3D protein structure into a sequence of discrete tokens by first serializing the protein structure into residue-level local structures and then embeds them into dense vector space. These vectors are then quantized into discrete structure tokens by a pre-trained clustering model. These tokens serve as an effective protein structure representation. Furthermore, ProSST explicitly learns the relationship between protein residue token sequences and structure token sequences through the sequence-structure disentangled attention. We pre-train ProSST on millions of protein structures using a masked language model objective, enabling it to learn comprehensive contextual representations of proteins. To evaluate the proposed ProSST, we conduct extensive experiments on the zero-shot mutation effect prediction and several supervised downstream tasks, where ProSST achieves the state-of-the-art performance among all baselines.

to image-text data during instruction fine-tuning not only
remedies the degradation of text-only tasks, but also boosts
VLM task accuracy. With an enhanced pre-training recipe
we build VILA, a Visual Language model family that consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art models, e.g., LLaVA1.5, across main benchmarks without bells and whistles.
Multi-modal pre-training also helps unveil appealing properties of VILA, including multi-image reasoning, enhanced
in-context learning, and better world knowledge. VILA is
also deployable on Jetson Orin for on-device VLM.

Recent advances in generative AI (gen AI) have created excitement about the potential of new technologies to offer a personal tutor for every learner and a teaching assistant for every teacher.

We argue that this is primarily due to the difficulties with verbalising pedagogical intuitions into gen AI prompts and the lack of good evaluation practices, reinforced by the challenges in defining excellent pedagogy. Here we present our work collaborating with learners and educators to translate high level principles from learning science into a pragmatic set of seven diverse educational benchmarks, spanning quantitative, qualitative, automatic and human
evaluations; and to develop a new set of fine-tuning datasets to improve the pedagogical capabilities of Gemini, introducing LearnLM-Tutor. Our evaluations show that LearnLM-Tutor is consistently preferred over a prompt tuned Gemini by educators and learners on a number of pedagogical dimensions.

To train large language models on Fugaku, the researchers developed distributed training methods, including porting the deep learning framework Megatron-DeepSpeed to Fugaku in order to optimize the performance of Transformers on Fugaku. They accelerated the dense matrix multiplication library for Transformers, and optimized communication performance for Fugaku by combining three types of parallelization techniques and accelerated the collective communication library on the Tofu interconnect D.

Docking and virtual screening tools are meaningful only if they are able to make fast, accurate, and useful predictions. A good model can filter true binders from a broad pool of potential molecules, including false positives that may be similar in chemical properties. In the hit identification stage of drug discovery it can give drug hunting teams a chemically-diverse set of potential hit molecules to evaluate with experimental assays or further computational analysis, helping them narrow the path to a lead candidate. In contrast, a bad model returns many false positives, costing a team money and effort – and potentially leading drug hunters off-course for months or years.

It remains a standard due to widespread use in benchmarking, facilitating comparison between models. It also enables accuracy prediction based on binding poses.

Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.

The new model is being overseen by recently hired Mustafa Suleyman – co-founder of Google DeepMind and former CEO of AI startup Inflection –  who joined Microsoft in March along with most of the startup’s employees through a deal worth $625 million. 

Microsoft may reportedly use training data and certain other assets from Inflection AI to train MAI-1. The model’s training dataset is also said to include other types of textual data as well, including text generated by GPT-4 and content scraped from the web. Microsoft is reportedly carrying out the development process using a “large cluster of servers” equipped with Nvidia Corp. graphics cards.

The exact purpose of the MAI-1 is not yet known and will depend on how well the model performs.

This setting reflects many challenges of real-world robotics, including active perception, agile full-body control, and long-horizon planning in a dynamic, partially-observable, multi-agent domain. We rely on large-scale, simulation-based data generation to obtain complex behaviors from egocentric vision which can be successfully transferred to physical robots using low-cost sensors. To achieve adequate visual realism, our simulation combines rigid-body physics with learned, realistic rendering via multiple Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). We combine teacher-based multi-agent RL and cross-experiment data reuse to enable the discovery of sophisticated soccer strategies. We analyze active-perception behaviors including object tracking and ball seeking that emerge when simply optimizing perception-agnostic soccer play. The agents display equivalent levels of performance and agility as policies with access to privileged, ground-truth state. To our knowledge, this paper constitutes a first demonstration of end-to-end training for multi-agent robot soccer, mapping raw pixel observations to joint-level actions, that can be deployed in the real world.

Gemini models, with strong general capabilities in multimodal and long-context reasoning, offer exciting possibilities in medicine. Building on these core strengths of Gemini, we introduce Med-Gemini, a family of highly capable multimodal models that are specialized in medicine with the ability to seamlessly use web search, and that can be efficiently tailored to novel modalities using custom encoders. We evaluate Med-Gemini on 14 medical benchmarks, establishing new state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on 10 of them, and surpass the GPT-4 model family on every benchmark where a direct comparison is viable, often by a wide margin. On the popular MedQA (USMLE) benchmark, our best-performing Med-Gemini model achieves SoTA performance of 91.1% accuracy, using a novel uncertainty-guided search strategy. On 7 multimodal benchmarks including NEJM Image Challenges and MMMU (health & medicine), Med-Gemini improves over GPT-4V by an average relative margin of 44.5%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Med-Gemini's long-context capabilities through SoTA performance on a needle-in-a-haystack retrieval task from long de-identified health records and medical video question answering, surpassing prior bespoke methods using only in-context learning. Finally, Med-Gemini's performance suggests real-world utility by surpassing human experts on tasks such as medical text summarization, alongside demonstrations of promising potential for multimodal medical dialogue, medical research and education. Taken together, our results offer compelling evidence for Med-Gemini's potential, although further rigorous evaluation will be crucial before real-world deployment in this safety-critical domain.",,,Unreleased,"United States of America,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Multinational,Canada,France,Multinational,United States of America,Canada,Switzerland",Gemini 1.5 Pro,,,,,2025-05-01 10:42,,,,,,"Industry,Industry",,,,,Unreleased,,"Industry,Industry",,,,,,,,,

Unlike traditional approaches, which are based on numerical weather prediction (NWP), GenCast is a machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) method, trained on decades of reanalysis data. GenCast generates an ensemble of stochastic 15-day global forecasts, at 12-hour steps and 0.25 degree latitude-longitude resolution, for over 80 surface and atmospheric variables, in 8 minutes. It has greater skill than ENS on 97.4% of 1320 targets we evaluated, and better predicts extreme weather, tropical cyclones, and wind power production.

DiffPepBuilder also introduces disulfide bonds to stabilize the generated peptide structures. We tested DiffPepBuilder on 30 experimentally verified strong peptide binders with available protein-peptide complex structures. DiffPepBuilder was able to effectively recall the native structures and sequences of the peptide ligands and to generate novel peptide binders with improved binding free energy. We subsequently conducted de novo generation case studies on three targets. In both the regeneration test and case studies, DiffPepBuilder outperformed AfDesign and RFdiffusion coupled with ProteinMPNN, in terms of sequence and structure recall, interface quality, and structural diversity. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that the introduction of disulfide bonds enhanced the structural rigidity and binding performance of the generated peptides.

However, current methodologies often fall short in illustrating the emergence of genomic insertions, duplications, and insertion/deletions (indels), which account for approximately 14% of human pathogenic mutations. Given that structure dictates function, mutated proteins with similar structures are more likely to persist throughout biological evolution. Motivated by this, we leverage crossmodality alignment and instruct fine-tuning techniques inspired by large language models to align a generative protein language model with protein structure instructions. Specifically, we present a method for generating variable-length and diverse proteins to explore and simulate the complex evolution of life, thereby expanding the repertoire of options for protein engineering. Our proposed protein LM-based approach, InstructPLM, demonstrates significant performance enhancements both in silico and in vitro. On native protein backbones, it achieves a perplexity of 2.68 and a sequence recovery rate of 57.51, surpassing Protein-MPNN by 39.2% and 25.1%, respectively. Furthermore, we validate the efficacy of our model by redesigning PETase and L-MDH. For PETase, all fifteen designed variable-length PETase exhibit depolymerization activity, with eleven surpassing the activity levels of the wild type.

They have become essential tools for researchers and practitioners in biology. However, a limitation of vanilla PLMs is their lack of explicit consideration for protein structure information, which suggests the potential for further improvement. Motivated by this, we introduce the concept of a “structure-aware vocabulary” that integrates residue tokens with structure tokens. The structure tokens are derived by encoding the 3D structure of proteins using Foldseek.

Accomplishing this goal requires learning to ground language in perception and embodied actions, in order to accomplish complex tasks. The Scalable, Instructable, Multiworld Agent (SIMA) project tackles this by training agents to follow free-form instructions across a diverse range of virtual 3D environments, including curated research environments as well as open-ended, commercial video games. Our goal is to develop an instructable agent that can accomplish anything a human can do in any simulated 3D environment. Our approach focuses on language-driven generality while imposing minimal assumptions. Our agents interact with environments in real-time using a generic, human-like interface: the inputs are image observations and language instructions and the outputs are keyboard-and-mouse actions. This general approach is challenging, but it allows agents to ground language across many visually complex and semantically rich environments while also allowing us to readily run agents in new environments. In this paper we describe our motivation and goal, the initial progress we have made, and promising preliminary results on several diverse research environments and a variety of commercial video games.",,,Unreleased,"United States of America,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Multinational,Canada,France",,,,,,2025-04-15 05:08,,,,,,Industry,,,,,Unreleased,,Industry,,,,,,,,,

Using the METL framework, we pretrain transformer-based neural networks on biophysical simulation data to capture fundamental relationships between protein sequence, structure, and energetics. We finetune METL on experimental sequence-function data to harness these biophysical signals and apply them when predicting protein properties like thermostability, catalytic activity, and fluorescence. METL excels in challenging protein engineering tasks like generalizing from small training sets and position extrapolation, although existing methods that train on evolutionary signals remain powerful for many types of experimental assays.

In this paper, we propose ESM-AA (ESM All-Atom), a novel approach that enables atom-scale and residue-scale unified molecular modeling.

In this work we demonstrate that transformers can instead learn to dynamically allocate FLOPs (or compute) to specific positions in a sequence, optimising the allocation along the sequence for different layers across the model depth. Our method enforces a total compute budget by capping the number of tokens (k) that can participate in the self-attention and MLP computations at a given layer. The tokens to be processed are determined by the network using a top-k routing mechanism. Since k is defined a priori, this simple procedure uses a static computation graph with known tensor sizes, unlike other conditional computation techniques. Nevertheless, since the identities of the k tokens are fluid, this method can expend FLOPs non-uniformly across the time and model depth dimensions. Thus, compute expenditure is entirely predictable in sum total, but dynamic and context-sensitive at the token-level. Not only do models trained in this way learn to dynamically allocate compute, they do so efficiently. These models match baseline performance for equivalent FLOPS and wall-clock times to train, but require a fraction of the FLOPs per forward pass, and can be upwards of 50\% faster to step during post-training sampling.",,,Unreleased,"United States of America,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Multinational,Canada,France,Canada,Canada",,,,,,2025-02-19 13:35,,,,,,"Industry,Academia,Academia",,,,,Unreleased,,"Industry,Academia,Academia",,,,,Reported,,,,

To alleviate these problems, we propose AUTODIFF, a diffusion-based fragment-wise autoregressive generation model. Specifically, we design a novel molecule assembly strategy named conformal motif that preserves the conformation of local structures of molecules first, then we encode the interaction of the protein-ligand complex with an SE(3)-equivariant convolutional network and generate molecules motif-by-motif with diffusion modeling. In addition, we also improve the evaluation framework of SBDD by constraining the molecular weights of the generated molecules in the same range, together with some new metrics, which make the evaluation more fair and practical.

Now we can systematically and comprehensively explore the dual nature of proteins that act and exist

Here, we leverage pLMs to simultaneously model both modalities by combining 1D sequences with 3D
structure in a single model. We encode protein structures as token sequences using the 3Di-alphabet
introduced by the 3D-alignment method Foldseek. This new foundation pLM extracts the features and
patterns of the resulting “structure-sequence” representation. Toward this end, we built a non-redundant

(ProstT5), we showed improved performance for subsequent prediction tasks, and for “inverse folding”,
namely the generation of novel protein sequences adopting a given structural scaffold (“fold”). Our work
showcased the potential of pLMs to tap into the information-rich protein structure revolution fueled by
AlphaFold2. ProstT5 paves the way to develop new tools integrating the vast resource of 3D predictions,

Our dataset comprises 400k visual instructions generated by GPT4, covering 16 vision-and-language tasks with open-ended instructions and answers. Unlike existing studies that primarily focus on positive instruction samples, we design LRV-Instruction to include both positive and negative instructions for more robust visual instruction tuning. Our negative instructions are designed at three semantic levels: (i) Nonexistent Object Manipulation, (ii) Existent Object Manipulation and (iii) Knowledge Manipulation. To efficiently measure the hallucination generated by LMMs, we propose GPT4-Assisted Visual Instruction Evaluation (GAVIE), a stable approach to evaluate visual instruction tuning like human experts. GAVIE does not require human-annotated groundtruth answers and can adapt to diverse instruction formats. We conduct comprehensive experiments to investigate the hallucination of LMMs. Our results demonstrate existing LMMs exhibit significant hallucinations when presented with our negative instructions, particularly Existent Object and Knowledge Manipulation instructions. Moreover, we successfully mitigate hallucination by finetuning MiniGPT4 and mPLUG-Owl on LRV-Instruction while improving performance on several public datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

 ",NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090,,Confident,"Performing language-conditioned robotic manipulation tasks in unstructured environments is highly demanded for general intelligent robots. Conventional robotic manipulation methods usually learn semantic representation of the observation for action prediction, which ignores the scene-level spatiotemporal dynamics for human goal completion. In this paper, we propose a dynamic Gaussian Splatting method named ManiGaussian for multi-task robotic manipulation, which mines scene dynamics via future scene reconstruction. Specifically, we first formulate the dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that infers the semantics propagation in the Gaussian embedding space, where the semantic representation is leveraged to predict the optimal robot action.

Specifically, our method incorporates a latent variable sequence containing supplementary acoustic information based on refined self-supervised learning (SSL) discrete units into the TTS model by a predictor. This significantly mitigates pronunciation errors and style mutations in synthesized speech. During training, we strategically replace and duplicate segments of the data to enhance timbre uniformity.

However, existing multi-modal models primarily emphasize capturing global information within each modality while neglecting the importance of perceiving local information across modalities. Consequently, these models lack the ability to effectively understand the fine-grained details of input data, limiting their performance in tasks that require a more nuanced understanding. To address this limitation, there is a compelling need to develop models that enable fine-grained understanding across multiple modalities, thereby enhancing their applicability to a wide range of tasks. In this paper, we propose GroundingGPT, a language enhanced multi-modal grounding model. Beyond capturing global information like other multi-modal models, our proposed model excels at tasks demanding a detailed understanding of local information within the input. It demonstrates precise identification and localization of specific regions in images or moments in videos. To achieve this objective, we design a diversified dataset construction pipeline, resulting in a multi-modal, multi-granularity dataset for model training.

Meanwhile, an appropriate architecture that can facilitate acquisition of enough information for prediction has to be designed. Existing methods ignore a fact that when input data undergoes layer-by-layer feature extraction and spatial transformation, large amount of information will be lost. This paper will delve into the important issues of data loss when data is transmitted through deep networks, namely information bottleneck and reversible functions. We proposed the concept of programmable gradient information (PGI) to cope with the various changes required by deep networks to achieve multiple objectives. PGI can provide complete input information for the target task to calculate objective function, so that reliable gradient information can be obtained to update network weights. In addition, a new lightweight network architecture -- Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN), based on gradient path planning is designed. GELAN's architecture confirms that PGI has gained superior results on lightweight models. We verified the proposed GELAN and PGI on MS COCO dataset based object detection. The results show that GELAN only uses conventional convolution operators to achieve better parameter utilization than the state-of-the-art methods developed based on depth-wise convolution. PGI can be used for variety of models from lightweight to large.

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of their amino acids greatly influence the structural and functional diversity of different protein types and uphold proteostasis, allowing cells to swiftly respond to environmental changes and intricately regulate complex biological processes. To this point, efforts to model the complex features of proteins have involved the training of large and expressive protein language models (pLMs) such as ESM-2 and ProtT5, which accurately encode structural, functional, and physicochemical properties of input protein sequences. However, the over 200 million sequences that these pLMs were trained on merely scratch the surface of proteomic diversity, as they neither input nor account for the effects of PTMs. In this work, we fill this major gap in protein sequence modeling by introducing PTM tokens into the pLM training regime. We then leverage recent advancements in structured state space models (SSMs), specifically Mamba, which utilizes efficient hardware-aware primitives to overcome the quadratic time complexities of Transformers. After adding a comprehensive set of PTM tokens to the model vocabulary, we train bidirectional Mamba blocks whose outputs are fused with state-of-the-art ESM-2 embeddings via a novel gating mechanism. We demonstrate that our resultant PTM-aware pLM, PTM-Mamba, improves upon ESM-2’s performance on various PTM-specific tasks. PTM-Mamba is the first and only pLM that can uniquely input and represent both wild-type and PTM sequences, motivating downstream modeling and design applications specific to post-translationally modified proteins.

Under the premise that protein sequences constitute the protein language, Protein Language Models(PLMs) have advanced the field of protein engineering. However, as of now, unlike LLMs in NLP, PLMs cannot handle the protein understanding task and the protein generation task simultaneously in the Protein Language Processing (PLP) field. This prompts us to delineate the inherent limitations in current PLMs: (i) the lack of natural language capabilities, (ii) insufficient instruction understanding, and (iii) high training resource demands. To address these challenges, we introduce a training framework to transform any general LLM into a PLM capable of handling multiple PLP tasks. To improve training efficiency, we propose Protein Vocabulary Pruning (PVP) for general LLMs. We construct a multi-task instruction dataset containing 13 million samples with superfamily information, facilitating better modeling of protein sequence-function landscapes. Through these methods, we develop the ProLLaMA model, the first known PLM to handle multiple PLP tasks simultaneously. Experiments show that ProLLaMA achieves state-of-the-art results in the unconditional protein sequence generation task.

For the second issue, PepGLAD explores a receptor-specific affine transformation to convert the 3D coordinates into a shared standard space, enabling better generalization ability across different binding shapes.

Recently, protein language models have emerged as the preferred method for this challenge, thanks to their ability to harness large sequence databases. Yet, their reliance on expansive sequence data and parameter sets limits their flexibility and practicality in real-world scenarios. Concurrently, the recent surge in computationally predicted protein structures unlocks new opportunities in protein representation learning. While promising, the computational burden carried by such complex data still hinders widely-adopted practical applications. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that enhances protein language models by integrating protein structural data. Drawing from recent advances in graph transformers, our approach refines the self-attention mechanisms of pretrained language transformers by integrating structural information with structure extractor modules. This refined model, termed Protein Structure Transformer (PST), is further pretrained on a small protein structure database, using the same masked language modeling objective as traditional protein language models. Empirical evaluations of PST demonstrate its superior parameter efficiency relative to protein language models, despite being pretrained on a dataset comprising only 542K structures. Notably, PST consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art foundation model for protein sequences, ESM-2, setting a new benchmark in protein function prediction.

Addressing these limitations, we introduce ProtHyena, a novel approach that leverages the Hyena operator. This innovative methodology circumvents the constraints imposed by attention mechanisms, thereby reducing the time complexity to a subquadratic, enabling the modeling of extra-long protein sequences at the single amino acid level without the need to compress data. ProtHyena is able to achieve, and in many cases exceed, state-of-the-art results in various downstream tasks with only 10% of the parameters typically required by attention-based models.

We first analyze the connection between the spatial and temporal modules of video models and the distribution shift to low-quality videos. We observe that full training of all modules results in a stronger coupling between spatial and temporal modules than only training temporal modules. Based on this stronger coupling, we shift the distribution to higher quality without motion degradation by finetuning spatial modules with high-quality images, resulting in a generic high-quality video model.

However, conventional MoE architectures like GShard, which activate the top-K out of N experts, face challenges in ensuring expert specialization, i.e. each expert acquires non-overlapping and focused knowledge. In response, we propose the DeepSeekMoE architecture towards ultimate expert specialization. It involves two principal strategies: (1) finely segmenting the experts into mN ones and activating mK from them, allowing for a more flexible combination of activated experts; (2) isolating Ks experts as shared ones, aiming at capturing common knowledge and mitigating redundancy in routed experts. Starting from a modest scale with 2B parameters, we demonstrate that DeepSeekMoE 2B achieves comparable performance with GShard 2.9B, which has 1.5 times the expert parameters and computation. In addition, DeepSeekMoE 2B nearly approaches the performance of its dense counterpart with the same number of total parameters, which set the upper bound of MoE models. Subsequently, we scale up DeepSeekMoE to 16B parameters and show that it achieves comparable performance with LLaMA2 7B, with only about 40% of computations. Further, our preliminary efforts to scale up DeepSeekMoE to 145B parameters consistently validate its substantial advantages over the GShard architecture, and show its performance comparable with DeepSeek 67B, using only 28.5% (maybe even 18.2%) of computations.",1.0,,Open weights (restricted use),China,,,,,,2024-11-10 17:26,,,,,,Industry,,,,,,abuse restrictions: https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-MoE/blob/main/LICENSE-MODEL,Industry,,,,,Operation counting,,,,

Recent advancements in deep learning have shown promise in addressing this challenge, with sampling-based and regression-based methods emerging as two prominent approaches. However, these methods have notable limitations. Sampling-based methods often suffer from low efficiency due to the need for generating multiple candidate structures for selection. On the other hand, regression-based methods offer fast predictions but may experience decreased accuracy. Additionally, the variation in protein sizes often requires external modules for selecting suitable binding pockets, further impacting efficiency. In this work, we propose FABind, an end-to-end model that combines pocket prediction and docking to achieve accurate and fast protein-ligand binding. FABind incorporates a unique ligand-informed pocket prediction module, which is also leveraged for docking pose estimation. The model further enhances the docking process by incrementally integrating the predicted pocket to optimize protein-ligand binding, reducing discrepancies between training and inference. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, our proposed FABind demonstrates strong advantages in terms of effectiveness and efficiency compared to existing methods.

According to rinna, on that date, the model was the best-performing one on the JSQuAD (2-shot) dataset, with an F1 score of 94.21, when evaluated using template v0.2 of Stability-AI/lm-evaluation-harness. When evaluated using template v0.3 on that same date, nekomata-14b was the best-performing model on the JCommonsenseQA (3-shot) dataset (with an accuracy of 92.23%), the MARC-ja (0-shot) dataset (with a balanced accuracy of 92.31%), and the jaqket-2 (1-shot) dataset (with an F1 score of 89.34). 

While the JSQuAD dataset alone is not a benchmark, it is part of the JGLUE benchmark.

With the advent of deep learning models, classification of important signals from these datasets has markedly improved. These models power critical data analyses for research and decision-making in biodiversity monitoring, animal behaviour studies, and natural resource management. However, deep learning models are often data-hungry and require a significant amount of labeled training data to perform well. While sufficient training data is available for certain taxonomic groups (e.g., common bird species), many classes (such as rare and endangered species, many non-bird taxa, and call-type) lack enough data to train a robust model from scratch. This study investigates the utility of feature embeddings extracted from audio classification models to identify bioacoustic classes other than the ones these models were originally trained on. We evaluate models on diverse datasets, including different bird calls and dialect types, bat calls, marine mammals calls, and amphibians calls. The embeddings extracted from the models trained on bird vocalization data consistently allowed higher quality classification than the embeddings trained on general audio datasets. The results of this study indicate that high-quality feature embeddings from large-scale acoustic bird classifiers can be harnessed for few-shot transfer learning, enabling the learning of new classes from a limited quantity of training data.

While including text in more than one language is an obvious way to acquire more pretraining data, multilinguality is often seen as a curse, and most model training efforts continue to focus near-exclusively on individual large languages. We believe that multilinguality can be a blessing and that it should be possible to substantially improve over the capabilities of monolingual models for small languages through multilingual training. In this study, we introduce Poro 34B, a 34 billion parameter model trained for 1 trillion tokens of Finnish, English, and programming languages, and demonstrate that a multilingual training approach can produce a model that not only substantially advances over the capabilities of existing models for Finnish, but also excels in translation and is competitive in its class in generating English and programming languages.

However, LLMs sometimes suffer from confabulations (or hallucinations), which can result in them making plausible but incorrect statements1,2. This hinders the use of current large models in scientific discovery. Here we introduce FunSearch (short for searching in the function space), an evolutionary procedure based on pairing a pretrained LLM with a systematic evaluator. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to surpass the best-known results in important problems, pushing the boundary of existing LLM-based approaches3. Applying FunSearch to a central problem in extremal combinatorics—the cap set problem—we discover new constructions of large cap sets going beyond the best-known ones, both in finite dimensional and asymptotic cases. This shows that it is possible to make discoveries for established open problems using LLMs. We showcase the generality of FunSearch by applying it to an algorithmic problem, online bin packing, finding new heuristics that improve on widely used baselines. In contrast to most computer search approaches, FunSearch searches for programs that describe how to solve a problem, rather than what the solution is. Beyond being an effective and scalable strategy, discovered programs tend to be more interpretable than raw solutions, enabling feedback loops between domain experts and FunSearch, and the deployment of such programs in real-world applications.",,,Open weights (unrestricted),"United States of America,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Multinational,Canada,France",PaLM 2,0,No finetuning,,,2025-02-14 15:50,,,,,,Industry,,,9.899999999999999e+24,,Unreleased,"Code to run FunSearch with an LLM of your choice is open source under Apache 2.0 (software) and CC-BY (all else).

As for SeamlessStreaming, our model leverages the Efficient Monotonic Multihead Attention mechanism to generate low-latency target translations without waiting for complete source utterances. As the first of its kind, SeamlessStreaming enables simultaneous speech-to-speech/text translation for multiple source and target languages. To ensure that our models can be used safely and responsibly, we implemented the first known red-teaming effort for multimodal machine translation, a system for the detection and mitigation of added toxicity, a systematic evaluation of gender bias, and an inaudible localized watermarking mechanism designed to dampen the impact of deepfakes.

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5× higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics.

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5× higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics.

However, training methods in the literature vary widely, and the field has yet to agree on a unified strategy for curating video data. In this paper, we identify and evaluate three different stages for successful training of video LDMs: text-to-image pretraining, video pretraining, and high-quality video finetuning. Furthermore, we demonstrate the necessity of a well-curated pretraining dataset for generating high-quality videos and present a systematic curation process to train a strong base model, including captioning and filtering strategies.

Finally, we demonstrate that our model provides a strong multi-view 3D-prior and can serve as a base to finetune a multi-view diffusion model that jointly generates multiple views of objects in a feedforward fashion, outperforming image-based methods at a fraction of their compute budget.

The current methodology to mitigate this issue primarily involves using a verifier model to assess the correctness of generated solution candidates, focusing either on the overall reasoning path or on an incomplete reasoning path. By rethinking this approach, we argue that assessing potentials of incomplete reasoning paths could be more advantageous as it guides towards correct final answers, transforming the task into a \textit{planning} problem. Our proposed verifier, the Outcome-supervision Value Model (OVM), employs outcome supervision for training, offering an efficient and intuitive method for \textit{planning} by prioritizing steps that lead to accurate conclusions over mere per-step correctness. Furthermore, the OVM eschews the need for labor-intensive annotations on step-level correctness, enhancing its scalability. Our experiments on two multi-step mathematical reasoning datasets, GSM8K and Game of 24, demonstrate the superior performance of the OVM model. Notably, in GSM8K, our \textbf{OVM-7B model achieves state-of-the-art results among LLMs up to 13B parameters}; especially it does not utilize GPT-4 or code execution.

However, the absence of pre-trained audio models capable of handling diverse audio types and tasks has hindered progress in this field. Consequently, most existing works have only been able to support a limited range of interaction capabilities. In this paper, we develop the Qwen-Audio model and address this limitation by scaling up audio-language pre-training to cover over 30 tasks and various audio types, such as human speech, natural sounds, music, and songs, to facilitate universal audio understanding abilities. However, directly co-training all tasks and datasets can lead to interference issues, as the textual labels associated with different datasets exhibit considerable variations due to differences in task focus, language, granularity of annotation, and text structure. To overcome the one-to-many interference, we carefully design a multi-task training framework by conditioning on a sequence of hierarchical tags to the decoder for encouraging knowledge sharing and avoiding interference through shared and specified tags respectively. Remarkably, Qwen-Audio achieves impressive performance across diverse benchmark tasks without requiring any task-specific fine-tuning, surpassing its counterparts. Building upon the capabilities of Qwen-Audio, we further develop Qwen-Audio-Chat, which allows for input from various audios and text inputs, enabling multi-turn dialogues and supporting various audio-central scenarios.

The proposed network is composed of task specific encoders, a common trunk in the middle, followed by task specific prediction heads. We first pre-train it by self-supervised masked training, followed by sequential training for the different tasks. We train the network on all major modalities, e.g.\ visual, audio, text and 3D, and report results on 22 diverse and challenging public benchmarks. We demonstrate empirically that, using a joint network to train across modalities leads to meaningful information sharing and this allows us to achieve state-of-the-art results on most of the benchmarks.

While recently proposed approaches show promise in generalization to novel objects, semantic concepts, or visual distribution shifts, generalization to new tasks remains challenging. For example, a language-conditioned policy trained on pick-and-place tasks will not be able to generalize to a folding task, even if the arm trajectory of folding is similar to pick-and-place. Our key insight is that this kind of generalization becomes feasible if we represent the task through rough trajectory sketches. We propose a policy conditioning method using such rough trajectory sketches, which we call RT-Trajectory, that is practical, easy to specify, and allows the policy to effectively perform new tasks that would otherwise be challenging to perform. We find that trajectory sketches strike a balance between being detailed enough to express low-level motion-centric guidance while being coarse enough to allow the learned policy to interpret the trajectory sketch in the context of situational visual observations. In addition, we show how trajectory sketches can provide a useful interface to communicate with robotic policies: they can be specified through simple human inputs like drawings or videos, or through automated methods such as modern image-generating or waypoint-generating methods. We evaluate RT-Trajectory at scale on a variety of real-world robotic tasks, and find that RT-Trajectory is able to perform a wider range of tasks compared to language-conditioned and goal-conditioned policies, when provided the same training data.",,,Unreleased,"United States of America,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Multinational,Canada,France,United States of America,United States of America",,,,,,2025-05-30 12:39,,,,,,"Industry,Academia,Academia",,,,,Unreleased,,"Industry,Academia,Academia",,,,,,,,,

We first introduce FOLDFLOW-BASE a simulation-free approach to learning deterministic continuous-time dynamics and matching invariant target distributions on SE(3). We next accelerate training by incorporating Riemannian optimal transport to create FOLDFLOW-OT leading to the construction of both more simple and stable flows. Finally, we design FOLDFLOW-SFM coupling both Riemannian OT and simulation-free training to learn stochastic continuous-time dynamics over SE(3). Our family of FOLDFLOW generative models offers several key advantages over previous approaches to the generative modeling of proteins: they are more stable and faster to train than diffusion-based approaches, and our models enjoy the ability to map any invariant source distribution to any invariant target distribution over SE(3).

To address this challenge, we introduce GAIA-1 ('Generative AI for Autonomy'), a generative world model that leverages video, text, and action inputs to generate realistic driving scenarios while offering fine-grained control over ego-vehicle behavior and scene features. Our approach casts world modeling as an unsupervised sequence modeling problem by mapping the inputs to discrete tokens, and predicting the next token in the sequence. Emerging properties from our model include learning high-level structures and scene dynamics, contextual awareness, generalization, and understanding of geometry. The power of GAIA-1's learned representation that captures expectations of future events, combined with its ability to generate realistic samples, provides new possibilities for innovation in the field of autonomy, enabling enhanced and accelerated training of autonomous driving technology.",,,Unreleased,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,,,,,2025-06-12 11:49,,,,,,Industry,,,,34560.0,Unreleased,,Industry,,,,,"Hardware,Reported",,,,

Recent developments have incorporated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) to align these models with human goals. However, SFT methods treat all training data with mixed quality equally, while RLFT methods require high-quality pairwise or ranking-based preference data. In this study, we present a novel framework, named OpenChat, to advance open-source language models with mixed-quality data. Specifically, we consider the general SFT training data, consisting of a small amount of expert data mixed with a large proportion of sub-optimal data, without any preference labels. We propose the C(onditioned)-RLFT, which regards different data sources as coarse-grained reward labels and learns a class-conditioned policy to leverage complementary data quality information. Interestingly, the optimal policy in C-RLFT can be easily solved through single-stage, RL-free supervised learning, which is lightweight and avoids costly human preference labeling. Through extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks, our openchat-13b fine-tuned with C-RLFT achieves the highest average performance among all 13b open-source language models. Moreover, we use AGIEval to validate the model generalization performance, in which only openchat-13b surpasses the base model. Finally, we conduct a series of analyses to shed light on the effectiveness and robustness of OpenChat.

Moreover, the ""ShareGPT dataset consists of approximately 70k user-shared conversations.” The fine-tuning method was Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (C-RLFT) [1].

The original ShareGPT dataset hasn’t been published. However, the OpenChat GitHub repository has a Jupyter notebook that was published in advance of the model and that provides details on a processed ShareGPT dataset that appears to have been used for training the model, based on a few details. The dataset is named “dataset_processed_v3/sharegpt_v3.2.train.parquet” and has a tokenizer named “imone/LLaMA2_13B_with_EOT_token” [2]. The elements in the dataset have a maximum length of 4096 tokens, the same sequence length the developers said they used [2], [1, page 6]. The dataset has at least 77k elements, which aligns with the developers’ description of the ShareGPT dataset as containing approximately 70k user conversations [2], [1, page 5]. The elements in the dataset have a mean length of 1911 tokens, so I will use that to estimate the number of tokens in the ShareGPT dataset [2].

We develop a reinforcement learning method inspired by direct collocation to generate parkour skills, including climbing over high obstacles, leaping over large gaps, crawling beneath low barriers, squeezing through thin slits, and running.

It may not be feasible to compete directly in this race, but there is an opportunity to conduct experiments in the direction of larger models in their shadow. Our aim is to train large language models for Hungarian. According to the knowledge transfer researches, a language model can adapt valuable knowledge from other languages.

This success has been mirrored in the realm of protein language models (pLMs), where proteins are encoded as text via their amino acid sequences. However, the training of pLMs, which involves tens to hundreds of millions of sequences and hundreds of millions to billions of parameters, poses a significant computational challenge.

In this study, we introduce a Small-Scale Protein Language Model (SS-pLM), a more accessible approach that requires training on merely millions of representative sequences, reducing the number of trainable parameters to 14.8M.

Our goal is to enable a single end-to-end trained model to both learn to map robot observations to actions and enjoy the benefits of large-scale pretraining on language and vision-language data from the web. To this end, we propose to co-fine-tune state-of-the-art vision-language models on both robotic trajectory data and Internet-scale vision-language tasks, such as visual question answering. In contrast to other approaches, we propose a simple, general recipe to achieve this goal: in order to fit both natural language responses and robotic actions into the same format, we express the actions as text tokens and incorporate them directly into the training set of the model in the same way as natural language tokens. We refer to such category of models as vision-language-action models (VLA) and instantiate an example of such a model, which we call RT-2. Our extensive evaluation (6k evaluation trials) shows that our approach leads to performant robotic policies and enables RT-2 to obtain a range of emergent capabilities from Internet-scale training. This includes significantly improved generalization to novel objects, the ability to interpret commands not present in the robot training data (such as placing an object onto a particular number or icon), and the ability to perform rudimentary reasoning in response to user commands (such as picking up the smallest or largest object, or the one closest to another object). We further show that incorporating chain of thought reasoning allows RT-2 to perform multi-stage semantic reasoning, for example figuring out which object to pick up for use as an improvised hammer (a rock), or which type of drink is best suited for someone who is tired (an energy drink).",,,Unreleased,"United States of America,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Multinational,Canada,France",PaLI-X,,"""For RT-2-PaLI-X-55B, we use learning rate 1e-3 and batch size 2048 and co-fine-tune the model for 80K gradient steps""

Here we show that by fine-tuning the RoseTTAFold structure prediction network on protein structure denoising tasks, we obtain a generative model of protein backbones that achieves outstanding performance on unconditional and topology-constrained protein monomer design, protein binder design, symmetric oligomer design, enzyme active site scaffolding and symmetric motif scaffolding for therapeutic and metal-binding protein design. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method, called RoseTTAFold diffusion (RFdiffusion), by experimentally characterizing the structures and functions of hundreds of designed symmetric assemblies, metal-binding proteins and protein binders. The accuracy of RFdiffusion is confirmed by the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a designed binder in complex with influenza haemagglutinin that is nearly identical to the design model.

The attention layer is the main bottleneck in scaling to longer sequences, as its runtime and memory increase quadratically in the sequence length. FlashAttention exploits the asymmetric GPU memory hierarchy to bring significant memory saving (linear instead of quadratic) and runtime speedup (2-4\times compared to optimized baselines), with no approximation. However, FlashAttention is still not nearly as fast as optimized matrix-multiply (GEMM) operations, reaching only 25-40\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s. We observe that the inefficiency is due to suboptimal work partitioning between different thread blocks and warps on the GPU, causing either low-occupancy or unnecessary shared memory reads/writes. We propose FlashAttention-2, with better work partitioning to address these issues. In particular, we (1) tweak the algorithm to reduce the number of non-matmul FLOPs (2) parallelize the attention computation, even for a single head, across different thread blocks to increase occupancy, and (3) within each thread block, distribute the work between warps to reduce communication through shared memory. These yield around 2\times speedup compared to FlashAttention, reaching 50-73\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s on A100 and getting close to the efficiency of GEMM operations. We empirically validate that when used end-to-end to train GPT-style models, FlashAttention-2 reaches training speed of up to 225 TFLOPs/s per A100 GPU (72\% model FLOPs utilization).",,,Unreleased,"United States of America,United States of America",,,,8.0,72.0,2025-06-19 12:44,,,,,,"Academia,Academia",,,,,,,"Academia,Academia",,,,6364.456563115679,,,,,

Specifically, the parallel representation allows for training parallelism. The recurrent representation enables low-cost O(1) inference, which improves decoding throughput, latency, and GPU memory without sacrificing performance. The chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear complexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly while recurrently summarizing the chunks.

However, the 3D reconstruction process remains challenging, as the 3D structures may exhibit substantial shape variations, while the 2D image acquisition suffers from a low signal-to-noise ratio, requiring to acquire very large datasets that are time-consuming to process. Current reconstruction methods are precise but computationally expensive, or faster but lack a physically-plausible model of large molecular shape variations. To fill this gap, we propose CryoChains that encodes large deformations of biomolecules via rigid body transformation of their chains, while representing their finer shape variations with the normal mode analysis framework of biophysics. Our synthetic data experiments on the human GABA\textsubscript{B} and heat shock protein show that CryoChains gives a biophysically-grounded quantification of the heterogeneous conformations of biomolecules, while reconstructing their 3D molecular structures at an improved resolution compared to the current fastest, interpretable deep learning method.",,,,"United States of America,United States of America",,,,,,2025-05-01 10:42,,,,,,"Academia,Academia",,,,,,,"Academia,Academia",,,,,,,,,

We propose a human evaluation framework for model answers along multiple axes including factuality, comprehension, reasoning, possible harm and bias.

However, human evaluation reveals key gaps. To resolve this, we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, knowledge recall and reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine.

Our key technical contribution is an exploration of the compatibility and the potential for joint optimization of the two types of objectives, which has led to a strategy for training xTrimoPGLM at an unprecedented scale of 100 billion parameters and 1 trillion training tokens. Our extensive experiments reveal that xTrimoPGLM significantly outperforms other advanced baselines in diverse protein understanding tasks (13 out of 15 tasks across four categories) and generates novel protein sequences which are structurally similar to natural ones. Furthermore, using the same xTrimoPGLM framework, we train an antibody-specific model (xTrimoPGLM-Ab) using 1 billion parameters.

",NVIDIA V100,,Confident,"Weather forecasting is important for science and society. At present, the most accurate forecast system is the numerical weather prediction (NWP) method, which represents atmospheric states as discretized grids and numerically solves partial diferential equations that describe the transition between those states1 . However, this procedure is computationally expensive. Recently, artifcial-intelligence-based methods2 have shown potential in accelerating weather forecasting by orders of magnitude, but the forecast accuracy is still signifcantly lower than that of NWP methods. Here we introduce an artifcial-intelligence-based method for accurate, medium-range global weather forecasting. We show that three-dimensional deep networks equipped with
Earth-specifc priors are efective at dealing with complex patterns in weather data, and that a hierarchical temporal aggregation strategy reduces accumulation errors in medium-range forecasting. Trained on 39 years of global data, our program, Pangu-Weather, obtains stronger deterministic forecast results on reanalysis data in all tested variables when compared with the world’s best NWP system, the operational integrated forecasting system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)3

tropical cyclones is also higher than that of ECMWF-HRES.",100.0,,Open weights (non-commercial),China,,,"Possibly based on Pangu 3? Pangu-Weather is mentioned in the Pangu 3 announcement.

LongNet has significant advantages: 1) it has a linear computation complexity and a logarithm dependency between any two tokens in a sequence; 2) it can be served as a distributed trainer for extremely long sequences; 3) its dilated attention is a drop-in replacement for standard attention, which can be seamlessly integrated with the existing Transformer-based optimization.

Similar to natural language models, researchers have proposed foundation models in genomics to learn generalizable features from unlabeled genome data that can then be fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as identifying regulatory elements. Due to the quadratic scaling of attention, previous Transformer-based genomic models have used 512 to 4k tokens as context (<0.001% of the human genome), significantly limiting the modeling of long-range interactions in DNA. In addition, these methods rely on tokenizers or fixed k-mers to aggregate meaningful DNA units, losing single nucleotide resolution where subtle genetic variations can completely alter protein function via single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Recently, Hyena, a large language model based on implicit convolutions was shown to match attention in quality while allowing longer context lengths and lower time complexity.

Pix2Struct is pretrained by learning to parse masked screenshots of web pages into simplified HTML. The web, with its richness of visual elements cleanly reflected in the HTML structure, provides a large source of pretraining data well suited to the diversity of downstream tasks. Intuitively, this objective subsumes common pretraining signals such as OCR, language modeling, image captioning. In addition to the novel pretraining strategy, we introduce a variable-resolution input representation and a more flexible integration of language and vision inputs, where language prompts such as questions are rendered directly on top of the input image.

To address this, we propose Protein Evolutionary Transformer (PoET), an autoregressive generative model of whole protein families that learns to generate sets of related proteins as sequences-of-sequences across tens of millions of natural protein sequence clusters. PoET can be used as a retrieval-augmented language model to generate and score arbitrary modifications conditioned on any protein family of interest, and can extrapolate from short context lengths to generalize well even for small families. This is enabled by a unique Transformer layer; we model tokens sequentially within sequences while attending between sequences order invariantly, allowing PoET to scale to context lengths beyond those used during training. In extensive experiments on deep mutational scanning datasets, we show that PoET outperforms existing protein language models and evolutionary sequence models for variant function prediction across proteins of all MSA depths.

This is particularly relevant in the current biotechnology landscape characterized by the proliferation of protein generative models, which necessitate a high-throughput and generalized PPI predictor for proteins regardless of conventional motifs or known biological functions. Our work addresses this need and provides strong evidence of the utility and reliability of protein language models (pLMs) in learning the PPI objective. We demonstrated that with the use of a sizable balanced dataset, pLMs achieve state-of-the-art performance metrics in PPI prediction on diverse proteins. To generate a dataset that allows for the approximation of these conditions, we implemented a novel synthetic data generation scheme to augment BIOGRID and Negatome datasets. The enhancement of these datasets was then used to fine-tune ProtBERT for PPI prediction to develop a model that we call SYNTERACT (SYNThetic data-driven protein-protein intERACtion Transformer). Our results are compelling, demonstrating 92% accuracy on validated positive and negative interacting pairs derived from 50 different organisms, all of which were excluded from the training phase. In addition to the high metrics, secondary analysis revealed that our synthetic negative data was able to successfully mimic actual negative samples, further reinforcing the integrity of synthetic data additions to PPI datasets. Another notable discovery was the ease in which previously existing PPI datasets could be predicted with simplistic features, calling into question if they can actually inform PPI prediction. We find that the subcellular compartment bias inherent to the compilation of these datasets is learnable with deep learning methods and demonstrate that our approach is not burdened by this disadvantage.",,,,United States of America,ProtBERT-BFD,,,,,2025-05-01 10:42,,,,70.0,,Academia,,,,,,,Academia,,,,,,,,,

We use QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of instruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets, multiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to run with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results show that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to state-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous SoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human and GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable alternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot benchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of chatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to ChatGPT.

We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of Transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, which parallelizes computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference, leading to the first non-transformer architecture to be scaled to tens of billions of parameters. Our experiments reveal that RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting that future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models.

The capability to retrieve medical knowledge, reason over it, and answer medical questions comparably to physicians has long been viewed as one such grand challenge.
Large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed significant progress in medical question answering; Med-PaLM was the first model to exceed a ""passing"" score in US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) style questions with a score of 67.2% on the MedQA dataset. However, this and other prior work suggested significant room for improvement, especially when models' answers were compared to clinicians' answers. Here we present Med-PaLM 2, which bridges these gaps by leveraging a combination of base LLM improvements (PaLM 2), medical domain finetuning, and prompting strategies including a novel ensemble refinement approach.
Med-PaLM 2 scored up to 86.5% on the MedQA dataset, improving upon Med-PaLM by over 19% and setting a new state-of-the-art. We also observed performance approaching or exceeding state-of-the-art across MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU clinical topics datasets.
We performed detailed human evaluations on long-form questions along multiple axes relevant to clinical applications. In pairwise comparative ranking of 1066 consumer medical questions, physicians preferred Med-PaLM 2 answers to those produced by physicians on eight of nine axes pertaining to clinical utility (p < 0.001). We also observed significant improvements compared to Med-PaLM on every evaluation axis (p < 0.001) on newly introduced datasets of 240 long-form ""adversarial"" questions to probe LLM limitations.
While further studies are necessary to validate the efficacy of these models in real-world settings, these results highlight rapid progress towards physician-level performance in medical question answering.",,,Unreleased,"Multinational,United States of America,Canada,Switzerland,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",PaLM 2,,,,,2025-05-01 10:42,,,,,,"Industry,Industry",,,,,Unreleased,,"Industry,Industry",,,,,,,,,

The quality of the learned representations appears to be dictated by the neural scaling laws as a function of the number of model parameters and observations, while imposing upper bounds on the model performance by the amount of available data and compute, which is costly.
In this study, we attempt to render the training of LLMs for program synthesis more efficient by unifying four key components: (1) model architectures, (2) learning methods, (3) infill sampling, and, (4) data distributions. Specifically, for the model architecture, we attempt to unify encoder and decoder-based models into a single prefix-LM. For learning methods, (i) causal language modeling, (ii) span corruption, (iii) infilling are unified into a simple learning algorithm. For infill sampling, we explore the claim of a ""free lunch"" hypothesis. For data distributions, the effect of a mixture distribution and multi-epoch training of programming and natural languages on model performance is explored.
We conduct a comprehensive series of empirical experiments on 1B LLMs, for which failures and successes of this exploration are distilled into five lessons. We will provide a final recipe for training and release CodeGen2 models in size 1B, 3.7B, 7B, and, 16B parameters, along with the training framework as open-source: this https URL.",,,Open weights (unrestricted),United States of America,,,,,,2024-11-01 10:05,,,,,,Industry,,,,,,apache 2.0,Industry,,,,,,,,,

However, personalizing these models to align with user-provided visual concepts remains a challenging problem. The task of T2I personalization poses multiple hard challenges, such as maintaining high visual fidelity while allowing creative control, combining multiple personalized concepts in a single image, and keeping a small model size. We present Perfusion, a T2I personalization method that addresses these challenges using dynamic rank-1 updates to the underlying T2I model. Perfusion avoids overfitting by introducing a new mechanism that ""locks"" new concepts' cross-attention Keys to their superordinate category. Additionally, we develop a gated rank-1 approach that enables us to control the influence of a learned concept during inference time and to combine multiple concepts. This allows runtime-efficient balancing of visual-fidelity and textual-alignment with a single 100KB trained model, which is five orders of magnitude smaller than the current state of the art. Moreover, it can span different operating points across the Pareto front without additional training. Finally, we show that Perfusion outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative terms.

""Whether bipedal or quadrupedal, navigation represents only a fraction of animal and human capabilities. Motivated by this observation, there is a growing interest in whole body control, i.e. tasks in which the whole body is used in flexible ways to interact with the environment. Examples include climbing (Rudin et al., 2022a), getting-up from the ground (Ma et al., 2023), catching objects (Ma et al., 2023), and mobile manipulation with legs (Cheng et al., 2023). Recently, reinforcement learning has been applied to learn simple soccer skills, including goalkeeping (Huang et al., 2022), ball manipulation on diverse terrains (Bohez et al., 2022; Ji et al., 2023), and shooting (Ji et al.,
2022). These works focus on a narrower set of skills than the 1v1 soccer game, and the quadrupedal platform is inherently more stable and therefore presents an easier learning challenge.""",,,,,,self-play training in simulation,,""".

We used Deep RL to train a humanoid robot with 20 actuated joints to play a simplified one-versus-one (1v1) soccer game. We first trained individual skills in isolation and then composed those skills end-to-end in a self-play setting. The resulting policy exhibits robust and dynamic movement skills such as rapid fall recovery, walking, turning, kicking and more; and transitions between them in a smooth, stable, and efficient manner - well beyond what is intuitively expected from the robot. The agents also developed a basic strategic understanding of the game, and learned, for instance, to anticipate ball movements and to block opponent shots. The full range of behaviors emerged from a small set of simple rewards. Our agents were trained in simulation and transferred to real robots zero-shot. We found that a combination of sufficiently high-frequency control, targeted dynamics randomization, and perturbations during training in simulation enabled good-quality transfer, despite significant unmodeled effects and variations across robot instances. Although the robots are inherently fragile, minor hardware modifications together with basic regularization of the behavior during training led the robots to learn safe and effective movements while still performing in a dynamic and agile way. Indeed, even though the agents were optimized for scoring, in experiments they walked 156% faster, took 63% less time to get up, and kicked 24% faster than a scripted baseline, while efficiently combining the skills to achieve the longer term objectives.

Machine learning has shown promise in learning latent relationships underlying the sequence-structure-function paradigm from massive protein sequence datasets. However, to date, limited attempts have been made in extending this continuum to include higher order genomic context information. Evolutionary processes dictate the specificity of genomic contexts in which a gene is found across phylogenetic distances, and these emergent genomic patterns can be leveraged to uncover functional relationships between gene products. Here, we trained a genomic language model (gLM) on millions of metagenomic scaffolds to learn the latent functional and regulatory relationships between genes. gLM learns contextualized protein embeddings that capture the genomic context as well as the protein sequence itself, and appears to encode biologically meaningful and functionally relevant information (e.g. phylogeny, enzymatic function). Our analysis of the attention patterns demonstrates that gLM is learning co-regulated functional modules (i.e. operons). Our findings illustrate that gLM’s unsupervised deep learning of the metagenomic corpus is an effective approach to encode functional semantics and regulatory syntax of genes in their genomic contexts, providing a promising avenue for uncovering complex relationships between  genes in a genomic region.",,,Open weights (non-commercial),United States of America,ESM2-650M,,,,,2025-04-30 10:04,,,,,,Academia,,,,,Open (non-commercial),"non-commercial license

Currently, the host of the majority of viruses is unknown. Here, we introduce EvoMIL, a deep learning method that predicts virus-host association at the species level from viral sequence only. The method combines a pre-trained large protein language model and attention-based multiple instance learning to allow protein-orientated predictions. Our results show that protein embeddings capture stronger predictive signals than traditional handcrafted features, including amino acids and DNA k-mers, and physio-chemical properties. EvoMIL binary classifiers achieve AUC values of over 0.95 for all prokaryotic and nearly 0.8 for almost all eukaryotic hosts. In multi-host prediction tasks, EvoMIL achieved median performance improvements of 8.6% in prokaryotic hosts and 1.8% in eukaryotic hosts. Furthermore, EvoMIL estimates the importance of single proteins in the prediction and maps them to an embedding landscape of all viral proteins, where proteins with similar functions are distinctly clustered together.

Author summary Being able to predict which viruses can infect which hosts, and identifying the specific proteins that are involved in these interactions, is crucial for understanding viral diseases and developing more effective treatments. Traditional methods for predicting these interactions rely on handcrafted common features among proteins, overlooking the importance of single proteins. We have developed a new method that combines a protein language model and multiple instance learning to allow host prediction directly from protein sequences, without the need to extract handcrafted features.

This paper shows that video masked autoencoder (VideoMAE) is a scalable and general self-supervised pre-trainer for building video foundation models. We scale the VideoMAE in both model and data with a core design. Specifically, we present a dual masking strategy for efficient pre-training, with an encoder operating on a subset of video tokens and a decoder processing another subset of video tokens. Although VideoMAE is very efficient due to high masking ratio in encoder, masking decoder can still further reduce the overall computational cost.

Existing works use mainly pretrained protein language models in feature extraction. However, the knowledge contained in the embedding features directly extracted from a pretrained model is task-agnostic. To obtain task-specific feature representations, a reasonable approach is to fine-tune a pretrained model based on labeled datasets from downstream tasks. To this end, we investigate the fine-tuning of a given pretrained protein language model for protein secondary structure prediction tasks. Specifically, we propose a novel end-to-end protein secondary structure prediction framework involving the lightweight fine-tuning of a pretrained model. The framework first introduces a few new parameters for each transformer block in the pretrained model, then updates only the newly introduced parameters, and then keeps the original pretrained parameters fixed during training. Extensive experiments on seven test sets, namely, CASP12, CASP13, CASP14, CB433, CB634, TEST2016, and TEST2018, show that the proposed framework outperforms existing predictors and achieves new state-of-the-art prediction performance. Furthermore, we also experimentally demonstrate that lightweight fine-tuning significantly outperforms full model fine-tuning and feature extraction in enabling models to predict secondary structures. Further analysis indicates that only a few top transformer blocks need to introduce new parameters, while skipping many lower transformer blocks has little impact on the prediction accuracy of secondary structures.",,,,China,ProtT5-XL-U50,6050000000000000000,,1.0,,2025-05-01 10:42,,,,,,Academia,,,,,,,Academia,,,,493.0421354054348,Hardware,,,,

However, sparse weight training often compromises accuracy, requiring extended training schedules to attain the accuracy of dense models. In contrast, our approach, Sparse Iso-FLOP Transformations (Sparse-IFT), uses sparsity to improve accuracy while maintaining dense model FLOPs. Using a single hyperparameter (i.e., the sparsity level), Sparse-IFTs efficiently replace dense layers, expanding the search space for optimal sparse masks. In addition, dynamic sparse training (DST) with Sparse-IFT models effectively navigate this larger sparse mask-weight space, which is evidenced by a spectral analysis using Ramanujan graph properties. Our study reveals a robust correlation among mask topology, weights, and final performance. Notably, without adjusting any training hyperparameters, replacing dense layers with Sparse-IFT yields significant improvements, such as a +3.5% boost for ResNet-18 on ImageNet and +0.9% for GPT-3 Small on the Open LLM leaderboard.

In this work, we propose AaudioGen, an auto-regressive generative model that generates audio samples conditioned on text inputs. AudioGen operates on a learnt discrete audio representation. The task of text-to-audio generation poses multiple challenges. Due to the way audio travels through a medium, differentiating ``objects'' can be a difficult task (e.g., separating multiple people simultaneously speaking). This is further complicated by real-world recording conditions (e.g., background noise, reverberation, etc.). Scarce text annotations impose another constraint, limiting the ability to scale models. Finally, modeling high-fidelity audio requires encoding audio at high sampling rate, leading to extremely long sequences. To alleviate the aforementioned challenges we propose an augmentation technique that mixes different audio samples, driving the model to internally learn to separate multiple sources. We curated 10 datasets containing different types of audio and text annotations to handle the scarcity of text-audio data points. For faster inference, we explore the use of multi-stream modeling, allowing the use of shorter sequences while maintaining a similar bitrate and perceptual quality. We apply classifier-free guidance to improve adherence to text. Comparing to the evaluated baselines, AudioGen outperforms over both objective and subjective metrics.

However, experimental methods are time-consuming and expensive. In recent years, a lot of computational predictors based on machine learning and deep learning models are proposed to reduce such consumption. But those methods often use MSA tools such as PSI-BLAST or NetSurfP to generate some statistical features and enter them into predictive models as necessary supplementary input. The input generation process normally takes long time, and there is no standard to specify which and how many statistic results should be provided to a prediction model. In addition, prediction of PBRs relies on residue local context, but the most appropriate scale is undetermined. Most works pre-selected certain residue features as input and a scale size based on expertise for certain type of PBRs. In this study, we propose a general tool-free end-to-end framework that can be applied to all types of PBRs, Multi-scale Protein Binding Residues Prediction using language model (MsPBRsP). We adopt a pre-trained language model ProtTrans to save the large consumption caused by MSA tools, and use protein sequence alone as input to our model. To ease scale size uncertainty, we construct multi-size windows in attention layer and multi-size kernels in convolutional layer. We test our framework on various benchmark datasets including PBRs from protein-protein, protein-nucleotide, protein-small ligand, heterodimer, homodimer and antibody-antigen interactions. Compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, MsPBRsP achieves superior performance with less running time and higher prediction rates on every PBRs prediction task.

We find strong evidence in support of this hypothesis across three different experiments, each of which reveal different facets of moral self-correction. We find that the capability for moral self-correction emerges at 22B model parameters, and typically improves with increasing model size and RLHF training. We believe that at this level of scale, language models obtain two capabilities that they can use for moral self-correction: (1) they can follow instructions and (2) they can learn complex normative concepts of harm like stereotyping, bias, and discrimination. As such, they can follow instructions to avoid certain kinds of morally harmful outputs.

We leverage efficient search techniques to explore an infinite and sparse program space. To bridge the large generalization gap between proxy and target tasks, we also introduce program selection and simplification strategies. Our method discovers a simple and effective optimization algorithm, Lion (EvoLved Sign Momentum). It is more memory-efficient than Adam as it only keeps track of the momentum. Different from adaptive optimizers, its update has the same magnitude for each parameter calculated through the sign operation. We compare Lion with widely used optimizers, such as Adam and Adafactor, for training a variety of models on different tasks. On image classification, Lion boosts the accuracy of ViT by up to 2% on ImageNet and saves up to 5x the pre-training compute on JFT. On vision-language contrastive learning, we achieve 88.3% zero-shot and 91.1% fine-tuning accuracy on ImageNet, surpassing the previous best results by 2% and 0.1%, respectively. On diffusion models, Lion outperforms Adam by achieving a better FID score and reducing the training compute by up to 2.3x. For autoregressive, masked language modeling, and fine-tuning, Lion exhibits a similar or better performance compared to Adam. Our analysis of Lion reveals that its performance gain grows with the training batch size. It also requires a smaller learning rate than Adam due to the larger norm of the update produced by the sign function. Additionally, we examine the limitations of Lion and identify scenarios where its improvements are small or not statistically significant.

However, it fails to explore the relationships at a more granular level, i.e., the token level. To mitigate this, we propose Knowledge-exploited Auto-encoder for Protein (KeAP), which performs token-level knowledge graph exploration for protein representation learning. In practice, non-masked amino acids iteratively query the associated knowledge tokens to extract and integrate helpful information for restoring masked amino acids via attention.

The capability to create new proteins with designed structures and functions would thus enable the engineering of cellular behavior and development of protein-based therapeutics and materials. Structure-based protein design aims to find structures that are designable (can be realized by a protein sequence), novel (have dissimilar geometry from natural proteins), and diverse (span a wide range of geometries). While advances in protein structure prediction have made it possible to predict structures of novel protein sequences, the combinatorially large space of sequences and structures limits the practicality of search-based methods. Generative models provide a compelling alternative, by implicitly learning the low-dimensional structure of complex data distributions. Here, we leverage recent advances in denoising diffusion probabilistic models and equivariant neural networks to develop Genie, a generative model of protein structures that performs discrete-time diffusion using a cloud of oriented reference frames in 3D space. Through in silico evaluations, we demonstrate that Genie generates protein backbones that are more designable, novel, and diverse than existing models. This indicates that Genie is capturing key aspects of the distribution of protein structure space and facilitates protein design with high success rates.

Although there are already many deep learning methods for predicting the sequence specificities of DBPs, they face two challenges as follows. Classic deep learning methods for DBPs prediction usually fail to capture the dependencies between genomic sequences since their commonly used one-hot codes are mutually orthogonal. Besides, these methods usually perform poorly when samples are inadequate. To address these two challenges, we developed a novel language model for mining DBPs using human genomic data and ChIP-seq datasets with decaying learning rates, named DNA Fine-tuned Language Model (DFLM). It can capture the dependencies between genome sequences based on the context of human genomic data and then fine-tune the features of DBPs tasks using different ChIP-seq datasets. First, we compared DFLM with the existing widely used methods on 69 datasets and we achieved excellent performance. Moreover, we conducted comparative experiments on complex DBPs and small datasets. The results show that DFLM still achieved a significant improvement. Finally, through visualization analysis of one-hot encoding and DFLM, we found that one-hot encoding completely cut off the dependencies of DNA sequences themselves, while DFLM using language models can well represent the dependency of DNA sequences.

Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2× speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4× faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.",509.02,Hybrid H3-2.7B,Open weights (unrestricted),"United States of America,United States of America",,,,8.0,,2025-05-28 16:06,,,,,,"Academia,Academia",,,,,Unreleased,"apache 2.0

SuperGLUE is more challenging than the widely used general language understanding evaluation (GLUE) benchmark, containing eight difficult language understanding tasks, including question answering, natural language inference, word sense disambiguation, coreference resolution, and reasoning. [Method] Instead of arbitrarily increasing the size of a pretrained language model (PLM), our aim is to 1) fully extract knowledge from the input pretraining data given a certain parameter budget, e.g., 6B, and 2) effectively transfer this knowledge to downstream tasks. To achieve goal 1), we propose self-evolution learning for PLMs to wisely predict the informative tokens that should be masked, and supervise the masked language modeling (MLM) process with rectified smooth labels. For goal 2), we leverage the prompt transfer technique to improve the low-resource tasks by transferring the knowledge from the foundation model and related downstream tasks to the target task. [Results] According to our submission record (Oct. 2022), with our optimized pretraining and fine-tuning strategies, our 6B Vega method achieved new state-of-the-art performance on 4/8 tasks, sitting atop the SuperGLUE leaderboard on Oct. 8, 2022, with an average score of 91.3.",,,Unreleased,"China,China,Singapore,Australia",,,,320.0,,2025-06-06 14:16,,,,,,"Academia,Academia,Academia,Academia",,,,,Unreleased,,"Academia,Academia,Academia,Academia",,,,255862.7534697245,,,,,

",NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090,,Confident,"Transformer and its variants achieve excellent results in various computer vision and natural language processing tasks, but high computational costs and reliance on large training datasets restrict their deployment in resource-constrained settings. Low-rank approximation of model weights has been
effective in compressing CNN models, but its application to transformers has been less explored and is less effective. Existing methods require the complete dataset to finetune compressed models, which are both time-consuming and data-hungry. This paper reveals that the features (i.e., activations) are low-rank, but model weights are surprisingly not
low-rank. Hence, AAFM is proposed, which adaptively determines the compressed model structure and locally compresses each linear layer’s output features rather than the model weights. A second stage, GFM, optimizes the entire compressed network holistically. Both AAFM and GFM only
use few training samples without labels, that is, they are fewshot, nsupervised, fast and effective. For example, with only 2K images without labels, 33% of the parameters are removed in DeiT-B with 18.8% relative throughput increase, but only a 0.23% accuracy loss for ImageNet recognition. The proposed
methods are successfully applied to the language modeling task in NLP, too. Besides, the few-shot compressed models generalize well in downstream tasks.",,Transformer + GFM,Unreleased,China,FAIRSEQ Adaptive Inputs,436941620000000000,"6 FLOP/token/parameter * 185000000 parameters * 103000000 tokens = 1.1433e+17 FLOP

Starting from random noise, such text-to-image diffusion models gradually synthesize images in an iterative fashion while conditioning on text prompts. We find that their synthesis behavior qualitatively changes throughout this process: Early in sampling, generation strongly relies on the text prompt to generate text-aligned content, while later, the text conditioning is almost entirely ignored. This suggests that sharing model parameters throughout the entire generation process may not be ideal. Therefore, in contrast to existing works, we propose to train an ensemble of text-to-image diffusion models specialized for different synthesis stages. To maintain training efficiency, we initially train a single model, which is then split into specialized models that are trained for the specific stages of the iterative generation process. Our ensemble of diffusion models, called eDiff-I, results in improved text alignment while maintaining the same inference computation cost and preserving high visual quality, outperforming previous large-scale text-to-image diffusion models on the standard benchmark. In addition, we train our model to exploit a variety of embeddings for conditioning, including the T5 text, CLIP text, and CLIP image embeddings. We show that these different embeddings lead to different behaviors. Notably, the CLIP image embedding allows an intuitive way of transferring the style of a reference image to the target text-to-image output. Lastly, we show a technique that enables eDiff-I's ""paint-with-words"" capability. A user can select the word in the input text and paint it in a canvas to control the output, which is very handy for crafting the desired image in mind.

Existing approaches usually pretrain protein language models on a large number of unlabeled amino acid sequences and then finetune the models with some labeled data in downstream tasks. Despite the effectiveness of sequence-based approaches, the power of pretraining on known protein structures, which are available in smaller numbers only, has not been explored for protein property prediction, though protein structures are known to be determinants of protein function. In this paper, we propose to pretrain protein representations according to their 3D structures. We first present a simple yet effective encoder to learn the geometric features of a protein. We pretrain the protein graph encoder by leveraging multiview contrastive learning and different self-prediction tasks. Experimental results on both function prediction and fold classification tasks show that our proposed pretraining methods outperform or are on par with the state-of-the-art sequence-based methods, while using much less pretraining data.

Despite this progress, almost all known compression schemes apply compression uniformly across DNN layers, although layers are heterogeneous in terms of parameter count and their impact on model accuracy. In this work, we provide a general framework for adapting the degree of compression across the model's layers dynamically during training, improving the overall compression, while leading to substantial speedups, without sacrificing accuracy. Our framework, called L-GreCo, is based on an adaptive algorithm, which automatically picks the optimal compression parameters for model layers guaranteeing the best compression ratio while satisfying an error constraint.

Generative SBDD methods leverage structural data of drugs in complex with their protein targets to propose new drug candidates. These approaches typically place one atom at a time in an autoregressive fashion using the binding pocket as well as previously added ligand atoms as context in each step. Recently a surge of diffusion generative models has entered this domain which hold promise to capture the statistical properties of natural ligands more faithfully. However, most existing methods focus exclusively on bottom-up de novo design of compounds or tackle other drug development challenges with task-specific models. The latter requires curation of suitable datasets, careful engineering of the models and retraining from scratch for each task. Here we show how a single pre-trained diffusion model can be applied to a broader range of problems, such as off-the-shelf property optimization, explicit negative design, and partial molecular design with inpainting. We formulate SBDD as a 3D-conditional generation problem and present DiffSBDD, an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that generates novel ligands conditioned on protein pockets. Our in silico experiments demonstrate that DiffSBDD captures the statistics of the ground truth data effectively.

Gemnet-OC took ~4*10^3 GPU-hours based in Figure 2",NVIDIA V100,,Likely,"Recent years have seen the advent of molecular simulation datasets that are orders of magnitude larger and more diverse. These new datasets differ substantially in four aspects of complexity: 1. Chemical diversity (number of different elements), 2. system size (number of atoms per sample), 3. dataset size (number of data samples), and 4. domain shift (similarity of the training and test set). Despite these large differences, benchmarks on small and narrow datasets remain the predominant method of demonstrating progress in graph neural networks (GNNs) for molecular simulation, likely due to cheaper training compute requirements. This raises the question -- does GNN progress on small and narrow datasets translate to these more complex datasets? This work investigates this question by first developing the GemNet-OC model based on the large Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset. GemNet-OC outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on OC20 by 16% while reducing training time by a factor of 10. We then compare the impact of 18 model components and hyperparameter choices on performance in multiple datasets. We find that the resulting model would be drastically different depending on the dataset used for making model choices. To isolate the source of this discrepancy we study six subsets of the OC20 dataset that individually test each of the above-mentioned four dataset aspects. We find that results on the OC-2M subset correlate well with the full OC20 dataset while being substantially cheaper to train on. Our findings challenge the common practice of developing GNNs solely on small datasets, but highlight ways of achieving fast development cycles and generalizable results via moderately-sized, representative datasets such as OC-2M and efficient models such as GemNet-OC.

A major drawback of these models is their size in terms of the number of parameters needed to be fitted and the amount of computational resources they require. Recently, 'distilled' models using the concept of student and teacher networks have been widely used in NLP. Here, we adapted this concept to the problem of protein sequence analysis, by developing DistilProtBert, a distilled version of the successful ProtBert model. Implementing this approach, we reduced the size of the network and the running time by 50%, and the computational resources needed for pretraining by 98% relative to ProtBert model. Using two published tasks, we showed that the performance of the distilled model approaches that of the full model. We next tested the ability of DistilProtBert to distinguish between real and random protein sequences. The task is highly challenging if the composition is maintained on the level of singlet, doublet and triplet amino acids. Indeed, traditional machine-learning algorithms have difficulties with this task. Here, we show that DistilProtBert preforms very well on singlet, doublet and even triplet-shuffled versions of the human proteome, with AUC of 0.92, 0.91 and 0.87, respectively. Finally, we suggest that by examining the small number of false-positive classifications (i.e. shuffled sequences classified as proteins by DistilProtBert), we may be able to identify de novo potential natural-like proteins based on random shuffling of amino acid sequences.",3.0,,Open weights (unrestricted),Israel,,,,,,2025-06-11 18:08,,,,,,Academia,,,,,Open source,"MIT license

Such knowledge could be extremely useful to robots aiming to act upon high-level, temporally extended instructions expressed in natural language. However, a significant weakness of language models is that they lack real-world experience, which makes it difficult to leverage them for decision making within a given embodiment. For example, asking a language model to describe how to clean a spill might result in a reasonable narrative, but it may not be applicable to a particular agent, such as a robot, that needs to perform this task in a particular environment. We propose to provide real-world grounding by means of pretrained skills, which are used to constrain the model to propose natural language actions that are both feasible and contextually appropriate. The robot can act as the language model's ""hands and eyes,"" while the language model supplies high-level semantic knowledge about the task. We show how low-level skills can be combined with large language models so that the language model provides high-level knowledge about the procedures for performing complex and temporally-extended instructions, while value functions associated with these skills provide the grounding necessary to connect this knowledge to a particular physical environment. We evaluate our method on a number of real-world robotic tasks, where we show the need for real-world grounding and that this approach is capable of completing long-horizon, abstract, natural language instructions on a mobile manipulator.

in the RNA field. With the rapid growth of sequencing technology, we have accumulated a massive amount
of unannotated RNA sequences. On the other hand, expensive experimental observatory results in only limited
numbers of annotated data and 3D structures. Hence, it is still challenging to design computational methods for
predicting their structures and functions. The lack of annotated data and systematic study causes inferior performance. To resolve the issue, we propose a novel RNA foundation model (RNA-FM) to take advantage of all
the 23 million non-coding RNA sequences through self-supervised learning. Within this approach, we discover
that the pre-trained RNA-FM could infer sequential and evolutionary information of non-coding RNAs without
using any labels. Furthermore, we demonstrate RNA-FM’s effectiveness by applying it to the downstream secondary/3D structure prediction, SARS-CoV-2 genome structure and evolution prediction, protein-RNA binding
preference modeling, and gene expression regulation modeling. The comprehensive experiments show that the
proposed method improves the RNA structural and functional modelling results significantly and consistently.

The training of FastSpeech model relies on an autoregressive teacher model for duration prediction (to provide more information as input) and knowledge distillation (to simplify the data distribution in output), which can ease the one-to-many mapping problem (i.e., multiple speech variations correspond to the same text) in TTS. However, FastSpeech has several disadvantages: 1) the teacher-student distillation pipeline is complicated and time-consuming, 2) the duration extracted from the teacher model is not accurate enough, and the target mel-spectrograms distilled from teacher model suffer from information loss due to data simplification, both of which limit the voice quality. In this paper, we propose FastSpeech 2, which addresses the issues in FastSpeech and better solves the one-to-many mapping problem in TTS by 1) directly training the model with ground-truth target instead of the simplified output from teacher, and 2) introducing more variation information of speech (e.g., pitch, energy and more accurate duration) as conditional inputs. Specifically, we extract duration, pitch and energy from speech waveform and directly take them as conditional inputs in training and use predicted values in inference. We further design FastSpeech 2s, which is the first attempt to directly generate speech waveform from text in parallel, enjoying the benefit of fully end-to-end inference. Experimental results show that 1) FastSpeech 2 achieves a 3x training speed-up over FastSpeech, and FastSpeech 2s enjoys even faster inference speed; 2) FastSpeech 2 and 2s outperform FastSpeech in voice quality, and FastSpeech 2 can even surpass autoregressive models.

However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention.
In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence.
We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing.
Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance.

Existing AI systems deployed to millions of users, however, are already making decisions loaded with moral implications, which poses a seemingly impossible challenge: teaching machines moral sense, while humanity continues to grapple with it.
To explore this challenge, we introduce Delphi, an experimental framework based on deep neural networks trained directly to reason about descriptive ethical judgments, e.g., ""helping a friend"" is generally good, while ""helping a friend spread fake news"" is not. Empirical results shed novel insights on the promises and limits of machine ethics; Delphi demonstrates strong generalization capabilities in the face of novel ethical situations, while off-the-shelf neural network models exhibit markedly poor judgment including unjust biases, confirming the need for explicitly teaching machines moral sense.
Yet, Delphi is not perfect, exhibiting susceptibility to pervasive biases and inconsistencies.

What does it take to break the 200 language barrier while ensuring safe, high quality results, all while keeping ethical considerations in mind? In No Language Left Behind, we took on this challenge by first contextualizing the need for low-resource language translation support through exploratory interviews with native speakers. Then, we created datasets and models aimed at narrowing the performance gap between low and high-resource languages. More specifically, we developed a conditional compute model based on Sparsely Gated Mixture of Experts that is trained on data obtained with novel and effective data mining techniques tailored for low-resource languages.

Critically, we evaluated the performance of over 40,000 different translation directions using a human-translated benchmark, Flores-200, and combined human evaluation with a novel toxicity benchmark covering all languages in Flores-200 to assess translation safety.

This strategy can naturally tap into the rich body of prior work on large language models, which have seen continued advances in capabilities and performance through scaling data and model sizes.

This paper presents Contrastive Captioner (CoCa), a minimalist design to pretrain an image-text encoder-decoder foundation model jointly with contrastive loss and captioning loss, thereby subsuming model capabilities from contrastive approaches like CLIP and generative methods like SimVLM. In contrast to standard encoder-decoder transformers where all decoder layers attend to encoder outputs, CoCa omits cross-attention in the first half of decoder layers to encode unimodal text representations, and cascades the remaining decoder layers which cross-attend to the image encoder for multimodal image-text representations. We apply a contrastive loss between unimodal image and text embeddings, in addition to a captioning loss on the multimodal decoder outputs which predicts text tokens autoregressively. By sharing the same computational graph, the two training objectives are computed efficiently with minimal overhead. CoCa is pretrained end-to-end and from scratch on both web-scale alt-text data and annotated images by treating all labels simply as text, seamlessly unifying natural language supervision for representation learning. Empirically, CoCa achieves state-of-the-art performance with zero-shot transfer or minimal task-specific adaptation on a broad range of downstream tasks, spanning visual recognition (ImageNet, Kinetics-400/600/700, Moments-in-Time), crossmodal retrieval (MSCOCO, Flickr30K, MSR-VTT), multimodal understanding (VQA, SNLI-VE, NLVR2), and image captioning (MSCOCO, NoCaps).

A collection of pretrained encoders perceive diverse modalities (such as vision, and language), and they dock with a language model that plays the role of a universal task layer. We propose a semi-causal language modeling objective to jointly pretrain the interface and the modular encoders. We subsume the advantages and capabilities from both causal and non-causal modeling, thereby combining the best of two worlds. Specifically, the proposed method not only inherits the capabilities of in-context learning and open-ended generation from causal language modeling, but also is conducive to finetuning because of the bidirectional encoders. More importantly, our approach seamlessly unlocks the combinations of the above capabilities, e.g., enabling in-context learning or instruction following with finetuned encoders.

However, there is still a need to bridge the gap between what RNNs are capable of in terms of efficiency and performance and real-world application requirements. The memory and computational requirements arising from propagating the activations of all the neurons at every time step to every connected neuron, together with the sequential dependence of activations, contribute to the inefficiency of training and using RNNs. We propose a solution inspired by biological neuron dynamics that makes the communication between RNN units sparse and discrete. This makes the backward pass with backpropagation through time (BPTT) computationally sparse and efficient as well. We base our model on the gated recurrent unit (GRU), extending it with units that emit discrete events for communication triggered by a threshold so that no information is communicated to other units in the absence of events. We show theoretically that the communication between units, and hence the computation required for both the forward and backward passes, scales with the number of events in the network. Our model achieves efficiency without compromising task performance, demonstrating competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art recurrent network models in real-world tasks, including language modeling.

In order to inform future research, prepare for disruptive new model capabilities, and ameliorate socially harmful effects, it is vital that we understand the present and near-future capabilities and limitations of language models. To address this challenge, we introduce the Beyond the Imitation Game benchmark (BIG-bench). BIG-bench currently consists of 204 tasks, contributed by 450 authors across 132 institutions. Task topics are diverse, drawing problems from linguistics, childhood development, math, common-sense reasoning, biology, physics, social bias, software development, and beyond. BIG-bench focuses on tasks that are believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language models. We evaluate the behavior of OpenAI's GPT models, Google-internal dense transformer architectures, and Switch-style sparse transformers on BIG-bench, across model sizes spanning millions to hundreds of billions of parameters. In addition, a team of human expert raters performed all tasks in order to provide a strong baseline. Findings include: model performance and calibration both improve with scale, but are poor in absolute terms (and when compared with rater performance); performance is remarkably similar across model classes, though with benefits from sparsity; tasks that improve gradually and predictably commonly involve a large knowledge or memorization component, whereas tasks that exhibit ""breakthrough"" behavior at a critical scale often involve multiple steps or components, or brittle metrics; social bias typically increases with scale in settings with ambiguous context, but this can be improved with prompting.",1.0,,Unreleased,United States of America,,,,,,2025-05-16 10:30,,,,262000.0,,Industry,,,,,Unreleased,,Industry,,,,,Operation counting,,,,

This phenomenon is counter-intuitive since there are few consecutive sentence-level repetitions in human corpora (e.g., 0.02\% in Wikitext-103). To investigate the underlying reasons for generating consecutive sentence-level repetitions, we study the relationship between the probabilities of the repetitive tokens and their previous repetitions in the context. Through our quantitative experiments, we find that 1) Language models have a preference to repeat the previous sentence; 2) The sentence-level repetitions have a \textit{self-reinforcement effect}: the more times a sentence is repeated in the context, the higher the probability of continuing to generate that sentence; 3) The sentences with higher initial probabilities usually have a stronger self-reinforcement effect. Motivated by our findings, we propose a simple and effective training method \textbf{DITTO} (Pseu\underline{D}o-Repet\underline{IT}ion Penaliza\underline{T}i\underline{O}n), where the model learns to penalize probabilities of sentence-level repetitions from pseudo repetitive data. Although our method is motivated by mitigating repetitions, experiments show that DITTO not only mitigates the repetition issue without sacrificing perplexity, but also achieves better generation quality.

At each diffusion timestep, there is a different noise-to-data ratio and the timestep-dependent discriminator learns to distinguish the diffused real data from the diffused generated data. The generator learns from the discriminator’s feedback by backpropagating through the forward diffusion chain, whose length is adaptively adjusted to balance the noise and data levels.

To date, there seems to be still no consensus on what the right architecture and pre-training setup should be. This paper presents a unified framework for pre-training models that are universally effective across datasets and setups. We begin by disentangling architectural archetypes with pre-training objectives -- two concepts that are commonly conflated. Next, we present a generalized and unified perspective for self-supervision in NLP and show how different pre-training objectives can be cast as one another and how interpolating between different objectives can be effective. We then propose Mixture-of-Denoisers (MoD), a pre-training objective that combines diverse pre-training paradigms together. We furthermore introduce a notion of mode switching, wherein downstream fine-tuning is associated with specific pre-training schemes. We conduct extensive ablative experiments to compare multiple pre-training objectives and find that our method pushes the Pareto-frontier by outperforming T5 and/or GPT-like models across multiple diverse setups. Finally, by scaling our model up to 20B parameters, we achieve SOTA performance on 50 well-established supervised NLP tasks ranging from language generation (with automated and human evaluation), language understanding, text classification, question answering, commonsense reasoning, long text reasoning, structured knowledge grounding and information retrieval.

However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity.

The accumulation of sequencing data has enabled researchers to predict the interactions between RNA sequences and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) using novel machine learning techniques. However, existing models are often difficult to interpret and require additional information to sequences. Bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT) is a language-based deep learning model that is highly interpretable. Therefore, a model based on BERT architecture can potentially overcome such limitations.

Results
Here, we propose BERT-RBP as a model to predict RNA–RBP interactions by adapting the BERT architecture pretrained on a human reference genome. Our model outperformed state-of-the-art prediction models using the eCLIP-seq data of 154 RBPs. The detailed analysis further revealed that BERT-RBP could recognize both the transcript region type and RNA secondary structure only based on sequence information. Overall, the results provide insights into the fine-tuning mechanism of BERT in biological contexts and provide evidence of the applicability of the model to other RNA-related problems.",3.0,,Open weights (non-commercial),Japan,DNABERT,22000000000000000,"""The models were trained on four NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs (128

To leverage these representations for image generation, we propose a two-stage model: a prior that generates a CLIP image embedding given a text caption, and a decoder that generates an image conditioned on the image embedding. We show that explicitly generating image representations improves image diversity with minimal loss in photorealism and caption similarity. Our decoders conditioned on image representations can also produce variations of an image that preserve both its semantics and style, while varying the non-essential details absent from the image representation. Moreover, the joint embedding space of CLIP enables language-guided image manipulations in a zero-shot fashion.

We propose MemSizer, an approach towards closing the performance gap while improving the efficiency even with short generation. It projects the source sequences into lower dimension representations like Linformer, while enjoying efficient recurrent-style incremental computation similar to kernel-based transformers. This yields linear computation time and constant memory complexity at inference time. MemSizer also employs a lightweight multi-head mechanism which renders the computation as light as a single-head model.

""To narrow the universe of molecules we chose to drive the generative model towards compounds like the nerve agent VX, one of the most toxic chemical warfare agents developed during the 20th century—a few salt-sized grains of VX, (6–10 mg)5, is sufficient to kill a person. Nerve agents such as Novichoks have also been in the headlines recently6.

In less than 6 hours after starting on our in-house server, our model generated forty thousand molecules that scored within our desired threshold. In the process, the AI designed not only VX, but many other known chemical warfare agents that we identified through visual confirmation with structures in public chemistry databases. Many new molecules were also designed that looked equally plausible. These new molecules were predicted to be more toxic based on the predicted LD50 in comparison to publicly known chemical warfare agents (Figure 1).

A short sequence length is important for an AR model to reduce its computational costs to consider long-range interactions of codes. However, we postulate that previous VQ cannot shorten the code sequence and generate high-fidelity images together in terms of the rate-distortion trade-off. In this study, we propose the two-stage framework, which consists of Residual-Quantized VAE (RQ-VAE) and RQ-Transformer, to effectively generate high-resolution images. Given a fixed codebook size, RQ-VAE can precisely approximate a feature map of an image and represent the image as a stacked map of discrete codes. Then, RQ-Transformer learns to predict the quantized feature vector at the next position by predicting the next stack of codes. Thanks to the precise approximation of RQ-VAE, we can represent a 256×256 image as 8×8 resolution of the feature map, and RQ-Transformer can efficiently reduce the computational costs. Consequently, our framework outperforms the existing AR models on various benchmarks of unconditional and conditional image generation. Our approach also has a significantly faster sampling speed than previous AR models to generate high-quality images.

Specifically, we target the problem of learning a rate control policy to select the quantization parameters (QP) in the encoding process of libvpx, an open source VP9 video compression library widely used by popular video-on-demand (VOD) services. We treat this as a sequential decision making problem to maximize the video quality with an episodic constraint imposed by the target bitrate. Notably, we introduce a novel self-competition based reward mechanism to solve constrained RL with variable constraint satisfaction difficulty, which is challenging for existing constrained RL methods. We demonstrate that the MuZero-based rate control achieves an average 6.28% reduction in size of the compressed videos for the same delivered video quality level (measured as PSNR BD-rate) compared to libvpx's two-pass VBR rate control policy, while having better constraint satisfaction behavior.",,,Unreleased,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,,,,,2025-06-16 10:42,,,,,,Industry,,,,,Unreleased,,Industry,,,,,,,,,

The first challenge, safety, involves ensuring that the model's responses are consistent with a set of human values, such as preventing harmful suggestions and unfair bias. We quantify safety using a metric based on an illustrative set of human values, and we find that filtering candidate responses using a LaMDA classifier fine-tuned with a small amount of crowdworker-annotated data offers a promising approach to improving model safety. The second challenge, factual grounding, involves enabling the model to consult external knowledge sources, such as an information retrieval system, a language translator, and a calculator. We quantify factuality using a groundedness metric, and we find that our approach enables the model to generate responses grounded in known sources, rather than responses that merely sound plausible.

General protein language models have been shown to summarize the semantics of protein sequences into representations that are useful for state-of-the-art predictive methods. However, for antibody specific problems, such as restoring residues lost due to sequencing errors, a model trained solely on antibodies may be more powerful. Antibodies are one of the few protein types where the volume of sequence data needed for such language models is available, e.g. in the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) database.

Results
Here, we introduce AbLang, a language model trained on the antibody sequences in the OAS database. We demonstrate the power of AbLang by using it to restore missing residues in antibody sequence data, a key issue with B-cell receptor repertoire sequencing, e.g. over 40% of OAS sequences are missing the first 15 amino acids. AbLang restores the missing residues of antibody sequences better than using IMGT germlines or the general protein language model ESM-1b. Further, AbLang does not require knowledge of the germline of the antibody and is seven times faster than ESM-1b.",20.0,,Open weights (unrestricted),United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,,,,,2025-06-02 14:56,,,,,,Academia,,,,,Unreleased," BSD-3-Clause license

Unlike prior work, Detic does not need complex assignment schemes to assign image labels to boxes based on model predictions, making it much easier to implement and compatible with a range of detection architectures and backbones. Our results show that Detic yields excellent detectors even for classes without box annotations. It outperforms prior work on both open-vocabulary and long-tail detection benchmarks. Detic provides a gain of 2.4 mAP for all classes and 8.3 mAP for novel classes on the open-vocabulary LVIS benchmark. On the standard LVIS benchmark, Detic obtains 41.7 mAP when evaluated on all classes, or only rare classes, hence closing the gap in performance for object categories with few samples.

While Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) sets continue to expand our understanding of the mutational landscape of single proteins, the results continue to challenge analyses. Protein Language Models (pLMs) use the latest deep learning (DL) algorithms to leverage growing databases of protein sequences. These methods learn to predict missing or masked amino acids from the context of entire sequence regions. Here, we used pLM representations (embeddings) to predict sequence conservation and SAV effects without multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). Embeddings alone predicted residue conservation almost as accurately from single sequences as ConSeq using MSAs (two-state Mat- thews Correlation Coefficient—MCC—for ProtT5 embeddings of 0.596 ± 0.006 vs. 0.608 ± 0.006 for ConSeq). Inputting the conservation prediction along with BLOSUM62 substitution scores and pLM mask reconstruction probabilities into a simplistic logistic regression (LR) ensemble for Variant Effect Score Prediction without Alignments (VESPA) predicted SAV effect magnitude without any optimization on DMS data. Comparing predictions for a standard set of 39 DMS experiments to other methods (incl. ESM-1v, DeepSequence, and GEMME) revealed our approach as competitive with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods using MSA input. No method outperformed all others, neither consistently nor statistically significantly, independently of the performance measure applied (Spearman and Pearson correlation). Finally, we investigated binary effect predictions on DMS experiments for four human proteins. Overall, embedding-based methods have become competi- tive with methods relying on MSAs for SAV effect prediction at a fraction of the costs in computing/energy. Our method predicted SAV effects for the entire human proteome (~ 20 k proteins) within 40 min on one Nvidia Quadro RTX 8000.

This paper presents a detailed empirical study of how autoregressive MoE language models scale in comparison with dense models in a wide range of settings: in- and out-of-domain language modeling, zero- and few-shot priming, and full-shot fine-tuning. With the exception of fine-tuning, we find MoEs to be substantially more compute efficient. At more modest training budgets, MoEs can match the performance of dense models using ∼4 times less compute. This gap narrows at scale, but our largest MoE model (1.1T parameters) consistently outperforms a compute-equivalent dense model (6.7B parameters). Overall, this performance gap varies greatly across tasks and domains, suggesting that MoE and dense models generalize differently in ways that are worthy of future study.

However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner.

Ideally, one would like to reduce their computational cost while retaining their generalization benefits. Sparse model training is a simple and promising approach to achieve this, but there remain challenges as existing methods struggle with accuracy loss, slow training runtime, or difficulty in sparsifying all model components. The core problem is that searching for a sparsity mask over a discrete set of sparse matrices is difficult and expensive. To address this, our main insight is to optimize over a continuous superset of sparse matrices with a fixed structure known as products of butterfly matrices. As butterfly matrices are not hardware efficient, we propose simple variants of butterfly (block and flat) to take advantage of modern hardware. Our method (Pixelated Butterfly) uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers (e.g., attention, MLP). We empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs.

Directly training of quantized neural networks is difficult. By formulating quantized RNNLMs training as an optimization problem, this paper presents a novel method to train quantized RNNLMs from scratch using alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMM). This method can also flexibly adjust the trade-off between the compression rate and model performance using tied low-bit quantization tables. Experiments on two tasks: Penn Treebank (PTB), and Switchboard (SWBD) suggest the proposed ADMM quantization achieved a model size compression factor of up to 31 times over the full precision baseline RNNLMs. Faster convergence of 5 times in model training over the baseline binarized RNNLM quantization was also obtained.

Furthermore, recent years have witnessed an exponential growth of the model scale--from Google's 2016 model with 1 billion parameters to the latest Facebook's model with 12 trillion parameters. Significant quality boost has come with each jump of the model capacity, which makes us believe the era of 100 trillion parameters is around the corner. However, the training of such models is challenging even within industrial scale data centers. This difficulty is inherited from the staggering heterogeneity of the training computation--the model's embedding layer could include more than 99.99% of the total model size, which is extremely memory-intensive; while the rest neural network is increasingly computation-intensive. To support the training of such huge models, an efficient distributed training system is in urgent need. In this paper, we resolve this challenge by careful co-design of both the optimization algorithm and the distributed system architecture. Specifically, in order to ensure both the training efficiency and the training accuracy, we design a novel hybrid training algorithm, where the embedding layer and the dense neural network are handled by different synchronization mechanisms; then we build a system called Persia (short for parallel recommendation training system with hybrid acceleration) to support this hybrid training algorithm.

While existing vision foundation models such as CLIP, ALIGN, and Wu Dao 2.0 focus mainly on mapping images and textual representations to a cross-modal shared representation, we introduce a new computer vision foundation model, Florence, to expand the representations from coarse (scene) to fine (object), from static (images) to dynamic (videos), and from RGB to multiple modalities (caption, depth). By incorporating universal visual-language representations from Web-scale image-text data, our Florence model can be easily adapted for various computer vision tasks, such as classification, retrieval, object detection, VQA, image caption, video retrieval and action recognition. Moreover, Florence demonstrates outstanding performance in many types of transfer learning: fully sampled fine-tuning, linear probing, few-shot transfer and zero-shot transfer for novel images and objects. All of these properties are critical for our vision foundation model to serve general purpose vision tasks.

The proposed LiT is widely applicable; it works reliably with multiple pre-training methods (supervised and unsupervised) and across diverse architectures (ResNet, Vision Transformers and MLP-Mixer) using three different image-text datasets.

Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of 10000 or more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by simulating the fundamental state space model (SSM) \( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) \), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state matrix \( A \), this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution. We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths. Our technique involves conditioning \( A \) with a low-rank correction, allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied computation of a Cauchy kernel.

To better understand this trade-off, we observe that sparse and low-rank approximations excel in different regimes, determined by the softmax temperature in attention, and sparse + low-rank can outperform each individually. Inspired by the classical robust-PCA algorithm for sparse and low-rank decomposition, we propose Scatterbrain, a novel way to unify sparse (via locality sensitive hashing) and low-rank (via kernel feature map) attention for accurate and efficient approximation.

Our model EVE (evolutionary model of variant effect) not only outperforms computational approaches that rely on labelled data but also performs on par with, if not better than, predictions from high-throughput experiments, which are increasingly used as evidence for variant classifcation12–16. We predict the pathogenicity of more than 36 million variants across 3,219 disease genes and provide evidence for the classification of more than 256,000 variants of unknown significance. Our work suggests that models of evolutionary information can provide valuable independent evidence for variant interpretation that will be widely useful in research and clinical settings.",,,Unreleased,"United States of America,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",,,,,,2025-04-30 10:04,,,,,,"Academia,Academia",,,,,Open source,"The model code is available at https://github.com/OATML-Markslab/EVE

Labeling approaches are expensive yet time-consuming, while the amount of unlabeled data is increasing quite faster than that of the labeled data due to low-cost, high-throughput sequencing methods. In order to extract knowledge from these unlabeled data, representation learning is of significant value for protein-related tasks and has great potential for helping us learn more about protein functions and structures. The key problem in the protein sequence representation learning is to capture the co-evolutionary information reflected by the inter-residue co-variation in the sequences. Instead of leveraging multiple sequence alignment as is usually done, we propose a novel method to capture this information directly by pre-training via a dedicated language model, i.e., Pairwise Masked Language Model (PMLM). In a conventional masked language model, the masked tokens are modeled by conditioning on the unmasked tokens only, but processed independently to each other. However, our proposed PMLM takes the dependency among masked tokens into consideration, i.e., the probability of a token pair is not equal to the product of the probability of the two tokens. By applying this model, the pre-trained encoder is able to generate a better representation for protein sequences. Our result shows that the proposed method can effectively capture the inter-residue correlations and improves the performance of contact prediction by up to 9% compared to the MLM baseline under the same setting. The proposed model also significantly outperforms the MSA baseline by more than 7% on the TAPE contact prediction benchmark when pre-trained on a subset of the sequence database which the MSA is generated from, revealing the potential of the sequence pre-training method to surpass MSA based methods in general.",,,,"China,Singapore,China,China",,,,24.0,,2025-05-01 10:42,,,,,,"Industry,Academia,Academia,Academia",,,,,,,"Industry,Academia,Academia,Academia",,,,14523.966055408006,,,,,

Deciphering the language of non-coding DNA is one of the fundamental problems in genome research. Gene regulatory code is highly complex due to the existence of polysemy and distant semantic relationship, which previous informatics methods often fail to capture especially in data-scarce scenarios.

Results
To address this challenge, we developed a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder representation, named DNABERT, to capture global and transferrable understanding of genomic DNA sequences based on up and downstream nucleotide contexts. We compared DNABERT to the most widely used programs for genome-wide regulatory elements prediction and demonstrate its ease of use, accuracy and efficiency. We show that the single pre-trained transformers model can simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art performance on prediction of promoters, splice sites and transcription factor binding sites, after easy fine-tuning using small task-specific labeled data. Further, DNABERT enables direct visualization of nucleotide-level importance and semantic relationship within input sequences for better interpretability and accurate identification of conserved sequence motifs and functional genetic variant candidates. Finally, we demonstrate that pre-trained DNABERT with human genome can even be readily applied to other organisms with exceptional performance. We anticipate that the pre-trained DNABERT model can be fined tuned to many other sequence analyses tasks.",4.04,,Open weights (unrestricted),United States of America,,,,,,2025-05-28 16:12,,,,,,Academia,,,,,Open source,"Apache 2.0, code and weights: https://github.com/jerryji1993/DNABERT",Academia,,,FP16,,"Hardware,Operation counting",,,,

To reduce the wall-clock training time, a common practice is to increase the batch size and learning rate. However, such practice is often brittle and leads to a so-called stability-efficiency dilemma: increasing the batch sizes and learning rates leads to better training efficiency but can also result in training instability, leading to poor generalization accuracy or failed runs. To better understand this phenomenon, we conduct an in-depth analysis on large-scale pre-training experiments replicating the GPT-2 model. We find that there is a strong correlation between training instability and extreme values of gradient variance, and that samples with long sequence lengths contribute to these extreme gradient variance values, especially at the beginning of the training, indicating that long sequence length can be a main source of training instability. Based on the analysis, we present a Sequence Length Warmup method that aims to solve the training stability-efficiency dilemma. Experiments replicating GPT-2 models show that our approach enables stable training with 8x larger batch size and 4x larger learning rate, whereas the baseline approach struggles with training instability. To achieve the same or better zero-shot evaluation results, our method reduces the required number of training tokens and wall clock time by up to 2.2x and 3.7x, respectively.

FMM decomposes particle-particle interaction into near-field and far-field components and then performs direct and coarse-grained computation, respectively. Similarly, FMMformers decompose the attention into near-field and far-field attention, modeling the near-field attention by a banded matrix and the far-field attention by a low-rank matrix. Computing the attention matrix for FMMformers requires linear complexity in computational time and memory footprint with respect to the sequence length. In contrast, standard transformers suffer from quadratic complexity. We analyze and validate the advantage of FMMformers over the standard transformer on the Long Range Arena and language modeling benchmarks. FMMformers can even outperform the standard transformer in terms
of accuracy by a significant margin. For instance, FMMformers achieve an average classification accuracy of 60.74% over the five Long Range Arena tasks, which is significantly better than the standard transformer’s average accuracy of 58.70%.",,FMMformer (2-kernel fast weight + Band20),Unreleased,"United States of America,United States of America",,,,4.0,,2025-04-07 12:33,,,FMMformer (2-kernel fast weight + Band20),,,"Academia,Academia",,,,,Unreleased,,"Academia,Academia",,,,3637.223067232183,Operation counting,,,,

NOTES BELOW

6.1: Each agent is trained using 8 TPUv3s and consumes approximately 50,000 agent steps (observations) per second.
Multiple agents interacting probably mean a fairly low utilization rate, so let’s assume 0.10
8 * 1.23e14 * 0.1 / 50k = 1.968e9 FLOPs per step

The paper doesn’t say exactly how many agents they train in each population. The original PBT paper uses 32 agents for one task (in general it uses between 10 and 80), so as a guesstimate let’s go with that.

Figure 16: They train over 5 generations. Summing the number of steps, it looks like there were roughly 383B steps

",Google TPU v3,Self-supervised learning,Speculative,"In this work we create agents that can perform well beyond a single, individual task, that exhibit much wider generalisation of behaviour to a massive, rich space of challenges. We define a universe of tasks within an environment domain and demonstrate the ability to train agents that are generally capable across this vast space and beyond. The environment is natively multi-agent, spanning the continuum of competitive, cooperative, and independent games, which are situated within procedurally generated physical 3D worlds. The resulting space is exceptionally diverse in terms of the challenges posed to agents, and as such, even measuring the learning progress of an agent is an open research problem. We propose an iterative notion of improvement between successive generations of agents, rather than seeking to maximise a singular objective, allowing us to quantify progress despite tasks being incomparable in terms of achievable rewards. We show that through constructing an open-ended learning process, which dynamically changes the training task distributions and training objectives such that the agent never stops learning, we achieve consistent learning of new behaviours. The resulting agent is able to score reward in every one of our humanly solvable evaluation levels, with behaviour generalising to many held-out points in the universe of tasks. Examples of this zero-shot generalisation include good performance on Hide and Seek, Capture the Flag, and Tag. Through analysis and hand-authored probe tasks we characterise the behaviour of our agent, and find interesting emergent heuristic behaviours such as trial-and-error experimentation, simple tool use, option switching, and cooperation. Finally, we demonstrate that the general capabilities of this agent could unlock larger scale transfer of behaviour through cheap finetuning.",,,Unreleased,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,,,,,2025-05-09 11:32,,,,64.0,,Industry,checked,,,,Unreleased,,Industry,$84799.79,,,,Hardware,,,,

To deal with these three problems, we propose the Hidden-Unit BERT (HuBERT) approach for self-supervised speech representation learning, which utilizes an offline clustering step to provide aligned target labels for a BERT-like prediction loss. A key ingredient of our approach is applying the prediction loss over the masked regions only, which forces the model to learn a combined acoustic and language model over the continuous inputs. HuBERT relies primarily on the consistency of the unsupervised clustering step rather than the intrinsic quality of the assigned cluster labels. Starting with a simple k-means teacher of 100 clusters, and using two iterations of clustering, the HuBERT model either matches or improves upon the state-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 performance on the Librispeech (960h) and Libri-light (60,000h) benchmarks with 10min, 1h, 10h, 100h, and 960h fine-tuning subsets.

Experiments on 5 widely used deep learning tasks (18 datasets in total), including neural machine translation, abstractive summarization, language understanding, language modeling, and image classification, show that R-Drop is universally effective. In particular, it yields substantial improvements when applied to fine-tune large-scale pre-trained models, e.g., ViT, RoBERTa-large, and BART, and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances with the vanilla Transformer model on WMT14 English→German translation (30.91 BLEU) and WMT14 English→French translation (43.95 BLEU), even surpassing models trained with extra large-scale data and expert-designed advanced variants of Transformer models.

While representation learning in NLP has transitioned to training on raw text without human annotations, visual and vision-language representations still rely heavily on curated training datasets that are expensive or require expert knowledge. For vision applications, representations are mostly learned using datasets with explicit class labels such as ImageNet or OpenImages. For vision-language, popular datasets like Conceptual Captions, MSCOCO, or CLIP all involve a non-trivial data collection (and cleaning) process. This costly curation process limits the size of datasets and hence hinders the scaling of trained models. In this paper, we leverage a noisy dataset of over one billion image alt-text pairs, obtained without expensive filtering or post-processing steps in the Conceptual Captions dataset. A simple dual-encoder architecture learns to align visual and language representations of the image and text pairs using a contrastive loss. We show that the scale of our corpus can make up for its noise and leads to state-of-the-art representations even with such a simple learning scheme.

In this paper we propose a new model architecture DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention) that improves the BERT and RoBERTa models using two novel techniques. The first is the disentangled attention mechanism, where each word is represented using two vectors that encode its content and position, respectively, and the attention weights among words are computed using disentangled matrices on their contents and relative positions, respectively. Second, an enhanced mask decoder is used to incorporate absolute positions in the decoding layer to predict the masked tokens in model pre-training. In addition, a new virtual adversarial training method is used for fine-tuning to improve models' generalization. We show that these techniques significantly improve the efficiency of model pre-training and the performance of both natural language understanding (NLU) and natural langauge generation (NLG) downstream tasks. Compared to RoBERTa-Large, a DeBERTa model trained on half of the training data performs consistently better on a wide range of NLP tasks, achieving improvements on MNLI by +0.9% (90.2% vs. 91.1%), on SQuAD v2.0 by +2.3% (88.4% vs. 90.7%) and RACE by +3.6% (83.2% vs. 86.8%).

This paper shows that recurrent neural networks can be reformulated as fixed-points of non-linear equation systems. These fixed-points can be computed using an iterative algorithm exactly and in as many iterations as the length of any given sequence. Each iteration of this algorithm adds one additional Markovian-like order of dependencies such that upon termination all dependencies modelled by the recurrent neural networks have been incorporated. Although exact fixed-points inherit the same parallelization and inconsistency issues, this paper shows that approximate fixed-points can be computed in parallel and used consistently in training and inference including tasks such as lattice rescoring.

The pretraining of BERT on a very large training corpus generates contextualized embeddings that can boost the performance of models trained on smaller datasets. Inspired by BERT, we propose Med-BERT, which adapts the BERT framework originally developed for the text domain to the structured EHR domain. Med-BERT is a contextualized embedding model pretrained on a structured EHR dataset of 28,490,650 patients. Fine-tuning experiments showed that Med-BERT substantially improves the prediction accuracy, boosting the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) by 1.21–6.14% in two disease prediction tasks from two clinical databases. In particular, pretrained Med-BERT obtains promising performances on tasks with small fine-tuning training sets and can boost the AUC by more than 20% or obtain an AUC as high as a model trained on a training set ten times larger, compared with deep learning models without Med-BERT.

Take this scenario: You’ve hiked Mt. Adams. Now you want to hike Mt. Fuji next fall, and you want to know what to do differently to prepare. Today, Google could help you with this, but it would take many thoughtfully considered searches — you’d have to search for the elevation of each mountain, the average temperature in the fall, difficulty of the hiking trails, the right gear to use, and more. After a number of searches, you’d eventually be able to get the answer you need.

But if you were talking to a hiking expert; you could ask one question — “what should I do differently to prepare?” You’d get a thoughtful answer that takes into account the nuances of your task at hand and guides you through the many things to consider.  

This example is not unique — many of us tackle all sorts of tasks that require multiple steps with Google every day. In fact, we find that people issue eight queries on average for complex tasks like this one.

In this work, we explore whether the UID hypothesis can be operationalized as an inductive bias for statistical language modeling. Specifically, we augment the canonical MLE objective for training language models with a regularizer that encodes UID. In experiments on ten languages spanning five language families, we find that using UID regularization consistently improves perplexity in language models, having a larger effect when training data is limited. Moreover, via an analysis of generated sequences, we find that UID-regularized language models have other desirable properties, e.g., they generate text that is more lexically diverse. Our results not only suggest that UID is a reasonable inductive bias for language modeling, but also provide an alternative validation of the UID hypothesis using modern-day NLP tools.",,Fairseq + UID: variance,Unreleased,"Multinational,United States of America,Switzerland,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",,,,,,2024-10-01 10:01,,,Fairseq + UID: variance,,,"Industry,Academia,Academia",,,,,Unreleased,,"Industry,Academia,Academia",,,,,,,,,

In this article, we propose a new formulation of the problem of generating sparse weights for a pre-trained neural network. By leveraging the properties of standard nonlinear activation functions, we show that the problem is equivalent to an approximate subdifferential inclusion problem. The accuracy of the approximation controls the sparsity. We show that the proposed approach is valid for a broad class of activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid, softmax). We propose an iterative optimization algorithm to induce sparsity whose convergence is guaranteed. Because of the algorithm flexibility, the sparsity can be ensured from partial training data in a minibatch manner. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we perform experiments on various networks in different applicative contexts: image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing, and time-series forecasting.

However, training these models efficiently is challenging for two reasons: a) GPU memory capacity is limited, making it impossible to fit large models on even a multi-GPU server, and b) the number of compute operations required to train these models can result in unrealistically long training times. Consequently, new methods of model parallelism such as tensor and pipeline parallelism have been proposed. Unfortunately, naive usage of these methods leads to fundamental scaling issues at thousands of GPUs, e.g., due to expensive cross-node communication or devices spending significant time waiting on other devices to make progress.
In this paper, we show how different types of parallelism methods (tensor, pipeline, and data parallelism) can be composed to scale to thousands of GPUs and models with trillions of parameters. We survey techniques for pipeline parallelism and propose a novel interleaved pipeline parallelism schedule that can improve throughput by 10+% with memory footprint comparable to existing approaches. We quantitatively study the trade-offs between tensor, pipeline, and data parallelism, and provide intuition as to how to configure distributed training of a large model.

It approximates the softmax attention with randomized or heuristic feature maps, but can be difficult to train and may yield suboptimal accuracy. This work aims to convert a pretrained transformer into its efficient recurrent counterpart, improving efficiency while maintaining accuracy. Specifically, we propose a swap-then-finetune procedure: in an off-the-shelf pretrained transformer, we replace the softmax attention with its linear-complexity recurrent alternative and then finetune. With a learned feature map, our approach provides an improved tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy over the standard transformer and other recurrent variants.

First, we propose a new multitask benchmark, RAINBOW, to promote research on commonsense models that generalize well over multiple tasks and datasets. Second, we propose a novel evaluation, the cost equivalent curve, that sheds new insight on how the choice of source datasets, pretrained language models, and transfer learning methods impacts performance and data efficiency.
We perform extensive experiments -- over 200 experiments encompassing 4800 models -- and report multiple valuable and sometimes surprising findings, e.g., that transfer almost always leads to better or equivalent performance if following a particular recipe, that QA-based commonsense datasets transfer well with each other, while commonsense knowledge graphs do not, and that perhaps counter-intuitively, larger models benefit more from transfer than smaller ones.

Our work revisits the canonical ResNet (He et al., 2015) and studies these three aspects in an effort to disentangle them. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that training and scaling strategies may matter more than architectural changes, and further, that the resulting ResNets match recent state-of-the-art models. We show that the best performing scaling strategy depends on the training regime and offer two new scaling strategies: (1) scale model depth in regimes where overfitting can occur (width scaling is preferable otherwise); (2) increase image resolution more slowly than previously recommended (Tan & Le, 2019). Using improved training and scaling strategies, we design a family of ResNet architectures, ResNet-RS, which are 1.7x - 2.7x faster than EfficientNets on TPUs, while achieving similar accuracies on ImageNet. In a large-scale semi-supervised learning setup, ResNet-RS achieves 86.2% top-1 ImageNet accuracy, while being 4.7x faster than EfficientNet NoisyStudent.

We observe that load imbalance may not be a significant problem affecting model quality, contrary to the perspectives of recent studies, while the number of sparsely activated experts k and expert capacity C in top-k routing can significantly make a difference in this context. Furthermore, we take a step forward to propose a simple method called expert prototyping that splits experts into different prototypes and applies k top-1 routing.

More importantly, we introduce a teacher-student strategy specific to transformers. It relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student learns from the teacher through attention. We show the interest of this token-based distillation, especially when using a convnet as a teacher. This leads us to report results competitive with convnets for both Imagenet (where we obtain up to 85.2% accuracy) and when transferring to other tasks.

The result is a sparsely-activated model -- with outrageous numbers of parameters -- but a constant computational cost.

We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques help wrangle the instabilities and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision (bfloat16) formats.

We demonstrate how combining the effectiveness of the inductive bias of CNNs with the expressivity of transformers enables them to model and thereby synthesize high-resolution images. We show how to (i) use CNNs to learn a context-rich vocabulary of image constituents, and in turn (ii) utilize transformers to efficiently model their composition within high-resolution images. Our approach is readily applied to conditional synthesis tasks, where both non-spatial information, such as object classes, and spatial information, such as segmentations, can control the generated image.

Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years.

In this paper, we present a HE and GC hybrid gated recurrent unit (GRU) network, CryptoGRU, for low-latency secure inferences. CryptoGRU replaces computationally expensive GC-based tanh with fast GC-based ReLU, and then quantizes sigmoid and ReLU with a smaller bit length to accelerate activations in a GRU.

In this work, we show that multilingual translation models can be created through multilingual finetuning. Instead of finetuning on one direction, a pretrained model is finetuned on many directions at the same time. Compared to multilingual models trained from scratch, starting from pretrained models incorporates the benefits of large quantities of unlabeled monolingual data, which is particularly important for low resource languages where bitext is not available. We demonstrate that pretrained models can be extended to incorporate additional languages without loss of performance. We double the number of languages in mBART to support multilingual machine translation models of 50 languages. Finally, we create the ML50 benchmark, covering low, mid, and high resource languages, to facilitate reproducible research by standardizing training and evaluation data. On ML50, we demonstrate that multilingual finetuning improves on average 1 BLEU over the strongest baselines (being either multilingual from scratch or bilingual finetuning) while improving 9.3 BLEU on average over bilingual baselines from scratch.

The new Hopfield network can store exponentially (with the dimension of the associative space) many patterns, retrieves the pattern with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. It has three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. The new update rule is equivalent to the attention mechanism used in transformers. This equivalence enables a characterization of the heads of transformer models. These heads perform in the first layers preferably global averaging and in higher layers partial averaging via metastable states. The new modern Hopfield network can be integrated into deep learning architectures as layers to allow the storage of and access to raw input data, intermediate results, or learned prototypes.

By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora.

10^7 steps (Figure 10)",,,,,Confident,"We introduce ADAHESSIAN, a second order stochastic optimization algorithm which dynamically incorporates the curvature of the loss function via ADAptive estimates of the HESSIAN. Second order algorithms are among the most powerful optimization algorithms with superior convergence properties as compared to first order methods such as SGD and Adam. The main disadvantage of traditional second order methods is their heavier per iteration computation and poor accuracy as compared to first order methods. To address these, we incorporate several novel approaches in ADAHESSIAN, including: (i) a fast Hutchinson based method to approximate the curvature matrix with low computational overhead; (ii) a root-mean-square exponential moving average to smooth out variations of the Hessian diagonal across different iterations; and (iii) a block diagonal averaging to reduce the variance of Hessian diagonal elements. We show that ADAHESSIAN achieves new state-of-the-art results by a large margin as compared to other adaptive optimization methods, including variants of Adam. In particular, we perform extensive tests on CV, NLP, and recommendation system tasks and find that ADAHESSIAN: (i) achieves 1.80%/1.45% higher accuracy on ResNets20/32 on Cifar10, and 5.55% higher accuracy on ImageNet as compared to Adam; (ii) outperforms AdamW for transformers by 0.13/0.33 BLEU score on IWSLT14/WMT14 and 2.7/1.0 PPL on PTB/Wikitext-103; (iii) outperforms AdamW for SqueezeBert by 0.41 points on GLUE; and (iv) achieves 0.032% better score than Adagrad for DLRM on the Criteo Ad Kaggle dataset.

Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.",0.6,GPT-3 175B (davinci),API access,United States of America,,,,10000.0,0.1968,2025-05-16 10:30,Microsoft,,,3200000.0,"3.2M, per table 2.1",Industry,checked,,,3552000.0,Unreleased,"https://openai.com/blog/openai-api

We present a new method that views object detection as a
direct set prediction problem. Our approach streamlines the detection
pipeline, effectively removing the need for many hand-designed components like a non-maximum suppression procedure or anchor generation
that explicitly encode our prior knowledge about the task. The main
ingredients of the new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or
DETR, are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Given
a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output
the final set of predictions in parallel. The new model is conceptually
simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other
modern detectors. DETR demonstrates accuracy and run-time performance on par with the well-established and highly-optimized Faster RCNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection dataset. Moreover, DETR can be easily generalized to produce panoptic segmentation
in a unified manner. We show that it significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Training code and pretrained models are available at

We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures.

Okay, let's break this down:

- You have a 2-layer LSTM model
- Each LSTM layer has 1500 hidden units
- The vocabulary size is 10k

For each LSTM layer:

- There are 4 weight matrices (input, forget, output, cell state) per layer 
- Each weight matrix has dimensions (input size x 1500 hidden units)
- Plus 1500 bias terms per matrix

Layer 1:
- Input size is 10k (vocab size)
- Weight matrices: 4 * (10k * 1500) = 60 million parameters 
- Biases: 4 * 1500 = 6000 parameters

Layer 2: 
- Input size is 1500 (output of layer 1)  
- Weight matrices: 4 * (1500 * 1500) = 9 million parameters
- Biases: 4 * 1500 = 6000 parameters

Total parameters = 60 million + 6000 + 9 million + 6000

Motivated by this observation, there has been significant recent interest in techniques that reduce the communication cost of distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), with gradient sparsification techniques such as top-k and random-k shown to be particularly effective. The same observation has also motivated a separate line of work in distributed statistical estimation theory focusing on the impact of communication constraints on the estimation efficiency of different statistical models. The primary goal of this paper is to connect these two research lines and demonstrate how statistical estimation models and their analysis can lead to new insights in the design of communication-efficient training techniques. We propose a simple statistical estimation model for the stochastic gradients which captures the sparsity and skewness of their distribution. The statistically optimal communication scheme arising from the analysis of this model leads to a new sparsification technique for SGD, which concatenates random-k and top-k, considered separately in the prior literature. We show through extensive experiments on both image and language domains with CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and Penn Treebank datasets that the concatenated application of these two sparsification methods consistently and significantly outperforms either method applied alone.",38.0,rTop-k(distributed setting),Unreleased,United States of America,,,,,,2025-04-09 12:24,,,,,,Academia,,,,,Unreleased,,Academia,,,,,Operation counting,,,,

",ImageNet,,,,,,NVIDIA V100,,Confident,"We address the challenging problem of efficient inference across many devices and resource constraints, especially on edge devices. Conventional approaches either manually design or use neural architecture search (NAS) to find a specialized neural network and train it from scratch for each case, which is computationally prohibitive (causing CO2 emission as much as 5 cars' lifetime) thus unscalable. In this work, we propose to train a once-for-all (OFA) network that supports diverse architectural settings by decoupling training and search, to reduce the cost. We can quickly get a specialized sub-network by selecting from the OFA network without additional training. To efficiently train OFA networks, we also propose a novel progressive shrinking algorithm, a generalized pruning method that reduces the model size across many more dimensions than pruning (depth, width, kernel size, and resolution). It can obtain a surprisingly large number of sub-networks (>1019) that can fit different hardware platforms and latency constraints while maintaining the same level of accuracy as training independently. On diverse edge devices, OFA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) NAS methods (up to 4.0% ImageNet top1 accuracy improvement over MobileNetV3, or same accuracy but 1.5x faster than MobileNetV3, 2.6x faster than EfficientNet w.r.t measured latency) while reducing many orders of magnitude GPU hours and CO2 emission.

Despite success in applications such as machine translation and voice recognition, these stateful models have several critical shortcomings. Specifically, RNNs generalize poorly over very long sequences, which limits their applicability to many important temporal processing and time series forecasting problems. For example, RNNs struggle in recognizing complex context free languages (CFLs), never reaching 100% accuracy on training. One way to address these shortcomings is to couple an RNN with an external, differentiable memory structure, such as a stack. However, differentiable memories in prior work have neither been extensively studied on CFLs nor tested on sequences longer than those seen in training. The few efforts that have studied them have shown that continuous differentiable memory structures yield poor generalization for complex CFLs, making the RNN less interpretable. In this paper, we improve the memory-augmented RNN with important architectural and state updating mechanisms that ensure that the model learns to properly balance the use of its latent states with external memory. Our improved RNN models exhibit better generalization performance and are able to classify long strings generated by complex hierarchical context free grammars (CFGs). We evaluate our models on CGGs, including the Dyck languages, as well as on the Penn Treebank language modelling task, and achieve stable, robust performance across these benchmarks.

Then, instead of training a model that predicts the original identities of the corrupted tokens, we train a discriminative model that predicts whether each token in the corrupted input was replaced by a generator sample or not. Thorough experiments demonstrate this new pre-training task is more efficient than MLM because the task is defined over all input tokens rather than just the small subset that was masked out.

This is different than batch normalization (BN), which is widely-adopted in Computer Vision. The preferred use of LN in NLP is principally due to the empirical observation that a (naive/vanilla) use of BN leads to significant performance degradation for NLP tasks; however, a thorough understanding of the underlying reasons for this is not always evident. In this paper, we perform a systematic study of NLP transformer models to understand why BN has a poor performance, as compared to LN. We find that the statistics of NLP data across the batch dimension exhibit large fluctuations throughout training. This results in instability, if BN is naively implemented. To address this, we propose Power Normalization (PN), a novel normalization scheme that resolves this issue by (i) relaxing zero-mean normalization in BN, (ii) incorporating a running quadratic mean instead of per batch statistics to stabilize fluctuations, and (iii) using an approximate backpropagation for incorporating the running statistics in the forward pass. We show theoretically, under mild assumptions, that PN leads to a smaller Lipschitz constant for the loss, compared with BN. Furthermore, we prove that the approximate backpropagation scheme leads to bounded gradients. We extensively test PN for transformers on a range of NLP tasks, and we show that it significantly outperforms both LN and BN. In particular, PN outperforms LN by 0.4/0.6 BLEU on IWSLT14/WMT14 and 5.6/3.0 PPL on PTB/WikiText-103.

This problem is of fundamental importance as the structure of a protein largely determines its function; however, protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures. Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of mean force that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP13)—a blind assessment of the state of the field—AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template modelling (TM) scores of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains.

Predicting protein function and structure from sequence is one important challenge for computational biology. For 26 years, most state-of-the-art approaches combined machine learning and evolutionary information. However, for some applications retrieving related proteins is becoming too time-consuming. Additionally, evolutionary information is less powerful for small families, e.g. for proteins from the Dark Proteome. Both these problems are addressed by the new methodology introduced here.
Results
We introduced a novel way to represent protein sequences as continuous vectors (embeddings) by using the language model ELMo taken from natural language processing. By modeling protein sequences, ELMo effectively captured the biophysical properties of the language of life from unlabeled big data (UniRef50). We refer to these new embeddings as SeqVec (Sequence-to-Vector) and demonstrate their effectiveness by training simple neural networks for two different tasks. At the per-residue level, secondary structure (Q3 = 79% ± 1, Q8 = 68% ± 1) and regions with intrinsic disorder (MCC = 0.59 ± 0.03) were predicted significantly better than through one-hot encoding or through Word2vec-like approaches. At the per-protein level, subcellular localization was predicted in ten classes (Q10 = 68% ± 1) and membrane-bound were distinguished from water-soluble proteins (Q2 = 87% ± 1). Although SeqVec embeddings generated the best predictions from single sequences, no solution improved over the best existing method using evolutionary information. Nevertheless, our approach improved over some popular methods using evolutionary information and for some proteins even did beat the best. Thus, they prove to condense the underlying principles of protein sequences. Overall, the important novelty is speed: where the lightning-fast HHblits needed on average about two minutes to generate the evolutionary information for a target protein, SeqVec created embeddings on average in 0.03 s. As this speed-up is independent of the size of growing sequence databases, SeqVec provides a highly scalable approach for the analysis of big data in proteomics, i.e. microbiome or metaproteome analysis.
Conclusion
Transfer-learning succeeded to extract information from unlabeled sequence databases relevant for various protein prediction tasks. SeqVec modeled the language of life, namely the principles underlying protein sequences better than any features suggested by textbooks and prediction methods. The exception is evolutionary information, however, that information is not available on the level of a single sequence.",,,Open weights (unrestricted),Germany,,,,5.0,,2025-04-30 10:04,,,,,,Academia,,,,2540.0,Unreleased,"MIT license. doesn't look like it has training code

language processing (NLP) systems like machine translation,
speech recognition, learning token embeddings, natural language generation and text classification. Recently, the multi-layer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models have been demonstrated to achieve promising performance on word-level language modeling.
For each LSTM layer, larger hidden size usually means more
diverse semantic features, which enables the language model to
perform better. However, we have observed that when a certain
LSTM layer reaches a sufficiently large scale, the promotion
of overall effect will slow down as its hidden size increases. In
this paper, we analyze that an important factor leading to this
phenomenon is the high correlation between the newly extended hidden states and original hidden states, which hinders diverse feature expression of the LSTM. As a result, when the scale is large enough, simply lengthening the LSTM hidden states will cost tremendous extra parameters but has little effect. We propose a simple yet effective improvement on each LSTM layer consisting of a large-scale Major LSTM and a smallscale Minor LSTM to break the high correlation between the two parts of hidden states, which we call Major-Minor LSTMs (MMLSTMs). In experiments, we demonstrate the language model with MMLSTMs surpasses the existing state-of-the-art model on Penn Treebank (PTB) and WikiText-2 (WT2) datasets, and outperforms the baseline by 3.3 points in perplexity on WikiText-103 dataset without increasing model parameter counts.",50.0,MMLSTM,Unreleased,"China,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",,,,,,2025-04-10 12:24,,,,,,"Academia,Academia",,,,,Unreleased,,"Academia,Academia",,,,,Operation counting,,,,

",,,,,Speculative,"In sequence learning tasks such as language modelling, Recurrent Neural Networks must learn relationships between input features separated by time. State of the art models such as LSTM and Transformer are trained by backpropagation of losses into prior hidden states and inputs held in memory. This allows gradients to flow from present to past and effectively learn with perfect hindsight, but at a significant memory cost. In this paper we show that it is possible to train high performance recurrent networks using information that is local in time, and thereby achieve a significantly reduced memory footprint. We describe a predictive autoencoder called bRSM featuring recurrent connections, sparse activations, and a boosting rule for improved cell utilization. The architecture demonstrates near optimal performance on a non-deterministic (stochastic) partially-observable sequence learning task consisting of high-Markov-order sequences of MNIST digits. We find that this model learns these sequences faster and more completely than an LSTM, and offer several possible explanations why the LSTM architecture might struggle with the partially observable sequence structure in this task. We also apply our model to a next word prediction task on the Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset. We show that a 'flattened' RSM network, when paired with a modern semantic word embedding and the addition of boosting, achieves 103.5 PPL (a 20-point improvement over the best N-gram models), beating ordinary RNNs trained with BPTT and approaching the scores of early LSTM implementations.

Prominent methods (e.g., Tacotron 2) usually first generate mel-spectrogram from text, and then synthesize speech from the mel-spectrogram using vocoder such as WaveNet. Compared with traditional concatenative and statistical parametric approaches, neural network based end-to-end models suffer from slow inference speed, and the synthesized speech is usually not robust (i.e., some words are skipped or repeated) and lack of controllability (voice speed or prosody control). In this work, we propose a novel feed-forward network based on Transformer to generate mel-spectrogram in parallel for TTS. Specifically, we extract attention alignments from an encoder-decoder based teacher model for phoneme duration prediction, which is used by a length regulator to expand the source phoneme sequence to match the length of the target mel-spectrogram sequence for parallel mel-spectrogram generation. Experiments on the LJSpeech dataset show that our parallel model matches autoregressive models in terms of speech quality, nearly eliminates the problem of word skipping and repeating in particularly hard cases, and can adjust voice speed smoothly. Most importantly, compared with autoregressive Transformer TTS, our model speeds up mel-spectrogram generation by 270x and the end-to-end speech synthesis by 38x.

AlphaX improves the search efficiency by adaptively balancing the exploration and exploitation at the state level, and by a Meta-Deep Neural Network (DNN) to predict network accuracies for biasing the search toward a promising region. To amortize the network evaluation cost, AlphaX accelerates MCTS rollouts with a distributed design and reduces the number of epochs in evaluating a network by transfer learning guided with the tree structure in MCTS.

However, very large models can be quite difficult to train due to memory constraints. In this work, we present our techniques for training very large transformer models and implement a simple, efficient intra-layer model parallel approach that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters. Our approach does not require a new compiler or library changes, is orthogonal and complimentary to pipeline model parallelism, and can be fully implemented with the insertion of a few communication operations in native PyTorch. We illustrate this approach by converging transformer based models up to 8.3 billion parameters using 512 GPUs. We sustain 15.1 PetaFLOPs across the entire application with 76% scaling efficiency when compared to a strong single GPU baseline that sustains 39 TeraFLOPs, which is 30% of peak FLOPs.

However, very large models can be quite difficult to train due to memory constraints. In this work, we present our techniques for training very large transformer models and implement a simple, efficient intra-layer model parallel approach that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters. Our approach does not require a new compiler or library changes, is orthogonal and complimentary to pipeline model parallelism, and can be fully implemented with the insertion of a few communication operations in native PyTorch. We illustrate this approach by converging transformer based models up to 8.3 billion parameters using 512 GPUs. We sustain 15.1 PetaFLOPs across the entire application with 76% scaling efficiency when compared to a strong single GPU baseline that sustains 39 TeraFLOPs, which is 30% of peak FLOPs. To demonstrate that large language models can further advance the state of the art (SOTA), we train an 8.3 billion parameter transformer language model similar to GPT-2 and a 3.9 billion parameter model similar to BERT. We show that careful attention to the placement of layer normalization in BERT-like models is critical to achieving increased performance as the model size grows. Using the GPT-2 model we achieve SOTA results on the WikiText103 (10.8 compared to SOTA perplexity of 15.8) and LAMBADA (66.5% compared to SOTA accuracy of 63.2%) datasets.

Results: We put forward a universal deep sequence model that is pretrained on unlabeled protein se- quences from Swiss-Prot and finetuned on protein classification tasks.

Using this approach, training and prediction in these networks require only constant memory, regardless of the effective ""depth"" of the network. We demonstrate how DEQs can be applied to two state-of-the-art deep sequence models: self-attention transformers and trellis networks.

For a query sequence, the pipeline starts with the collection of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) from multiple genome and metagenome sequence databases using two complementary Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based searching tools. Three profile matrices, built on covariance, precision, and pseudolikelihood maximization respectively, are then created from the MSAs, which are used as the input features of a deep residual convolutional neural network architecture for contact-map training and prediction. Two ensembling strategies have been proposed to integrate the matrix features through end-to-end training and stacking, resulting in two complementary programs called TripletRes and ResTriplet, respectively. For the 31 free-modeling domains that do not have homologous templates in the PDB, TripletRes and ResTriplet generated comparable results with an average accuracy of 0.640 and 0.646, respectively, for the top L/5 long-range predictions, where 71% and 74% of the cases have an accuracy above 0.5. Detailed data analyses showed that the strength of the pipeline is due to the sensitive MSA construction and the advanced strategies for coevolutionary feature ensembling. Domain splitting was also found to help enhance the contact prediction performance. Nevertheless, contact models for tail regions, which often involve a high number of alignment gaps, and for targets with few homologous sequences are still suboptimal.

However, it severely suffers from two issues: impotent in capturing very long-term dependencies and unable to parallelize the sequential computation procedure. Therefore, many non-recurrent sequence models that are built on convolution and attention operations have been proposed recently. Notably, models with multi-head attention such as Transformer have demonstrated extreme effectiveness in capturing long-term dependencies in a variety of sequence modeling tasks. Despite their success, however, these models lack necessary components to model local structures in sequences and heavily rely on position embeddings that have limited effects and require a considerable amount of design efforts. In this paper, we propose the R-Transformer which enjoys the advantages of both RNNs and the multi-head attention mechanism while avoids their respective drawbacks. The proposed model can effectively capture both local structures and global long-term dependencies in sequences without any use of position embeddings.

In the domain of robotic locomotion, deep RL could enable learning locomotion skills with minimal engineering and without an explicit model of the robot dynamics. Unfortunately, applying deep RL to real-world robotic tasks is exceptionally difficult, primarily due to poor sample complexity and sensitivity to hyperparameters. While hyperparameters can be easily tuned in simulated domains, tuning may be prohibitively expensive on physical systems, such as legged robots, that can be damaged through extensive trial-and-error learning. In this paper, we propose a sample-efficient deep RL algorithm based on maximum entropy RL that requires minimal per-task tuning and only a modest number of trials to learn neural network policies. We apply this method to learning walking gaits on a real-world Minitaur robot. Our method can acquire a stable gait from scratch directly in the real world in about two hours, without relying on any model or simulation, and the resulting policy is robust to moderate variations in the environment.

Semi-supervised learning has emerged as an important paradigm in protein modeling due to the high cost of acquiring supervised protein labels, but the current literature is fragmented when it comes to datasets and standardized evaluation techniques. To facilitate progress in this field, we introduce the Tasks Assessing Protein Embeddings (TAPE), a set of five biologically relevant semi-supervised learning tasks spread across different domains of protein biology. We curate tasks into specific training, validation, and test splits to ensure that each task tests biologically relevant generalization that transfers to real-life scenarios. We benchmark a range of approaches to semi-supervised protein representation learning, which span recent work as well as canonical sequence learning techniques. We find that self-supervised pretraining is helpful for almost all models on all tasks, more than doubling performance in some cases. Despite this increase, in several cases features learned by self-supervised pretraining still lag behind features extracted by state-of-the-art non-neural techniques.

To improve the sample efficiency, this paper proposes Latent Action Neural Architecture Search (LaNAS), which learns actions to recursively partition the search space into good or bad regions that contain networks with similar performance metrics. During the search phase, as different action sequences lead to regions with different performance, the search efficiency can be significantly improved by biasing towards the good regions. On three NAS tasks, empirical results demonstrate that LaNAS is at least an order more sample efficient than baseline methods including evolutionary algorithms, Bayesian optimizations, and random search. When applied in practice, both one-shot and regular LaNAS consistently outperform existing results.

Using several examples, we show that the network can associate distant causes and effects in a discrete stochastic process, predict partially-observable higher-order sequences, and enable a DQN agent to navigate a maze by giving it memory. The network uses only biologically-plausible, local and immediate credit assignment. Memory requirements are typically one order of magnitude less than existing LSTM, GRU and autoregressive feed-forward sequence learning models. The most significant limitation of the memory is generalization to unseen input sequences.

In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet.
To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flowers (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.

Learning shared output label mappings helps, but existing methods have limited expressivity and are prone to overfitting. In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of more powerful shared mappings for output labels, and propose a deep residual output mapping with dropout between layers to better capture the structure of the output space and avoid overfitting. Evaluations on three language generation tasks show that our output label mapping can match or improve state-of-the-art recurrent and self-attention architectures, and suggest that the classifier does not necessarily need to be high-rank to better model natural language if it is better at capturing the structure of the output space.",1000.0,AWD-LSTM-DRILL + dynamic evaluation† (WT2),Open weights (unrestricted),Switzerland,,,,,,2025-06-11 18:01,,,,,,Academia,,,,,Open source,"copyleft license (restricts derivative works to be open)

Although on average underperforming AlphaFold in 3D modeling, RaptorX predicted correct folds for all FM targets with >300 residues (T0950-D1, T0969-D1 and T1000-D2) and generated the best 3D models for T0950-D1 and T0969-D1 among all groups. This CASP13 test confirms our previous findings: (1) predicted distance is more useful than contacts for both template-based and free modeling; and (2) structure modeling may be improved by integrating alignment and co- evolutionary information via deep learning.

Unlike previous works that capture contexts by multi-scale features fusion, we propose a Dual Attention Networks (DANet) to adaptively integrate local features with their global dependencies. Specifically, we append two types of attention modules on top of traditional dilated FCN, which model the semantic interdependencies in spatial and channel dimensions respectively. The position attention module selectively aggregates the features at each position by a weighted sum of the features at all positions. Similar features would be related to each other regardless of their distances. Meanwhile, the channel attention module selectively emphasizes interdependent channel maps by integrating associated features among all channel maps. We sum the outputs of the two attention modules to further improve feature representation which contributes to more precise segmentation results. We achieve new state-of-the-art segmentation performance on three challenging scene segmentation datasets, i.e., Cityscapes, PASCAL Context and COCO Stuff dataset.

In this paper, we explore effective Transformer architectures for language model, including adding additional LSTM layers to better capture the sequential context while still keeping the computation efficient.

Language modelling requiring learning from longer sequences are affected by the need for more information in memory. This paper introduces Long Term Memory network (LTM), which can tackle the exploding and vanishing gradient problems and handles long sequences without forgetting.

However, the prohibitive computational demand of conventional NAS algorithms (e.g. 104 GPU hours) makes it difficult to \emph{directly} search the architectures on large-scale tasks (e.g. ImageNet). Differentiable NAS can reduce the cost of GPU hours via a continuous representation of network architecture but suffers from the high GPU memory consumption issue (grow linearly w.r.t. candidate set size). As a result, they need to utilize~\emph{proxy} tasks, such as training on a smaller dataset, or learning with only a few blocks, or training just for a few epochs. These architectures optimized on proxy tasks are not guaranteed to be optimal on the target task. In this paper, we present \emph{ProxylessNAS} that can \emph{directly} learn the architectures for large-scale target tasks and target hardware platforms. We address the high memory consumption issue of differentiable NAS and reduce the computational cost (GPU hours and GPU memory) to the same level of regular training while still allowing a large candidate set.

Structures are not known for the vast majority of protein sequences, but structure is critical for understanding function. Existing approaches for detecting structural similarity between proteins from sequence are unable to recognize and exploit structural patterns when sequences have diverged too far, limiting our ability to transfer knowledge between structurally related proteins. We newly approach this problem through the lens of representation learning. We introduce a framework that maps any protein sequence to a sequence of vector embeddings --- one per amino acid position --- that encode structural information. We train bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) models on protein sequences with a two-part feedback mechanism that incorporates information from (i) global structural similarity between proteins and (ii) pairwise residue contact maps for individual proteins. To enable learning from structural similarity information, we define a novel similarity measure between arbitrary-length sequences of vector embeddings based on a soft symmetric alignment (SSA) between them. Our method is able to learn useful position-specific embeddings despite lacking direct observations of position-level correspondence between sequences. We show empirically that our multi-task framework outperforms other sequence-based methods and even a top-performing structure-based alignment method when predicting structural similarity, our goal. Finally, we demonstrate that our learned embeddings can be transferred to other protein sequence problems, improving the state-of-the-art in transmembrane domain prediction.",,,,United States of America,,,,1.0,,2025-05-01 10:42,,,,,,Academia,,,,,,,Academia,,,,339.7842620513041,Hardware,,,,

The model has 2 hidden LSTM layers, each with 1500 hidden units

Each LSTM unit is a multi-cell LSTM with 10 memory cells per unit

For a standard LSTM layer with n hidden units:

W matrix: n x input_size
U matrix: n x n
4 bias vectors of size n (for input, forget, cell, output gates)
So for each multi-cell LSTM layer with 1500 units and 10 cells per unit:

W matrix: 1500 x input_size
U matrix: 1500 x 1500
4 bias vectors of size 1500
Number of parameters is same as standard LSTM layer

For the 2 hidden layers:

Input size for Layer 1: embedding dimension (estimated 300 in paper)

Input size for Layer 2: 1500 (output of layer 1)

Total params =
Layer 1: 1500 x (300 + 1500 + 4) = 2,706,000
Layer 2: 1500 x (1500 + 1500 + 4) = 4,506,000

Total Parameters = 2,706,000 + 4,506,000 = 7,212,000

We use Mesh-TensorFlow to implement an efficient data-parallel, model-parallel version of the Transformer sequence-to-sequence model. Using TPU meshes of up to 512 cores, we train Transformer models with up to 5 billion parameters, surpassing state of the art results on WMT'14 English-to-French translation task and the one-billion-word language modeling benchmark.

The low-resolution (LR) inputs and features contain abundant low-frequency information, which is treated equally across channels, hence hindering the representational ability of CNNs. To solve these problems, we propose the very deep residual channel attention networks (RCAN). Specifically, we propose residual in residual (RIR) structure to form very deep network, which consists of several residual groups with long skip connections. Each residual group contains some residual blocks with short skip connections. Meanwhile, RIR allows abundant low-frequency information to be bypassed through multiple skip connections, making the main network focus on learning high-frequency information. Furthermore, we propose channel attention mechanism to adaptively rescale channel-wise features by considering interdependencies among channels.

Significant improvements in the prediction of protein residue–residue contacts are observed in the recent years. These contacts, predicted using a variety of coevolution-based and machine learning methods, are the key contributors to the recent progress in ab initio protein structure prediction, as demonstrated in the recent CASP experiments. Continuing the development of new methods to reliably predict contact maps is essential to further improve ab initio structure prediction.

Results
In this paper we discuss DNCON2, an improved protein contact map predictor based on two-level deep convolutional neural networks. It consists of six convolutional neural networks—the first five predict contacts at 6, 7.5, 8, 8.5 and 10 Å distance thresholds, and the last one uses these five predictions as additional features to predict final contact maps. On the free-modeling datasets in CASP10, 11 and 12 experiments, DNCON2 achieves mean precisions of 35, 50 and 53.4%, respectively, higher than 30.6% by MetaPSICOV on CASP10 dataset, 34% by MetaPSICOV on CASP11 dataset and 46.3% by Raptor-X on CASP12 dataset, when top L/5 long-range contacts are evaluated. We attribute the improved performance of DNCON2 to the inclusion of short- and medium-range contacts into training, two-level approach to prediction, use of the state-of-the-art optimization and activation functions, and a novel deep learning architecture that allows each filter in a convolutional layer to access all the input features of a protein of arbitrary length.",1600.0,,Open weights (unrestricted),United States of America,,,,,,2025-04-30 10:04,,,,,,Academia,,,,,Open source,license: https://github.com/multicom-toolbox/DNCON2?tab=GPL-3.0-1-ov-file#readme,Academia,,,,,Hardware,,,,

In this paper, we present a method for training RNNLMs to simultaneously optimize likelihood and follow a given set of statistical constraints on text generation.  The problem is challenging because the statistical constraints are defined over aggregate model behavior, rather than model parameters, meaning that a straightforward parameter regularization approach is insufficient.  We solve this problem using a dynamic regularizer that updates as training proceeds, based on the generative behavior of the RNNLMs.  Our experiments show that the dynamic regularizer outperforms both generic training and a static regularization baseline.  The approach is successful at improving word-level repetition statistics by a factor of four in RNNLMs on a definition modeling task.  It also improves model perplexity when the statistical constraints are $n$-gram statistics taken from a large corpus.",20.0,RNNLM + Dynamic KL Regularization (WT2),Unreleased,United States of America,,,,,,2025-04-16 13:41,,,,,,Academia,,,,,Unreleased,"code, but not experiment code: https://github.com/northanapon/seqmodel/tree/aaai18 ",Academia,,,,,Operation counting,,,,

Specifically, we propose residual dense block (RDB) to extract abundant local features via dense connected convolutional layers. RDB further allows direct connections from the state of preceding RDB to all the layers of current RDB, leading to a contiguous memory (CM) mechanism. Local feature fusion in RDB is then used to adaptively learn more effective features from preceding and current local features and stabilizes the training of wider network. After fully obtaining dense local features, we use global feature fusion to jointly and adaptively learn global hierarchical features in a holistic way.

Instead of using external cues, e.g., pose estimation, to directly locate parts, this paper lays emphasis on the content consistency within each part.
Specifically, we target at learning discriminative part-informed features for person retrieval and make two contributions. (i) A network named Part-based Convolutional Baseline (PCB). Given an image input, it outputs a convolutional descriptor consisting of several part-level features. With a uniform partition strategy, PCB achieves competitive results with the state-of-the-art methods, proving itself as a strong convolutional baseline for person retrieval.
(ii) A refined part pooling (RPP) method. Uniform partition inevitably incurs outliers in each part, which are in fact more similar to other parts. RPP re-assigns these outliers to the parts they are closest to, resulting in refined parts with enhanced within-part consistency. Experiment confirms that RPP allows PCB to gain another round of performance boost.

AGZ had two models, one of which was small and another of which was large. The compute for AGZ is for the large model, which has 40 residual blocks instead of 20.

A second way of looking at this... we believe multiple TPUs were used for training. 29 million games * 211 moves per game on average * 0.8 seconds per move = 4.8952E+09 seconds of player-time across all TPUs.

4.8952E+09 seconds of player-time / (40 days * 24 * 60 * 60 seconds of real time) ~= 1,416 players

4 TPUs per player => 4.8952E+09 * 4 = 1.95808E+10 TPU-seconds
Total compute = 1.95808E+10 TPU-seconds * 92E+12 FLOP/(TPU-second) * 0.4 = 7.2e23 FLOP

Independently reducing the sizes of basic structures can result in inconsistent dimensions among them, and consequently, end up with invalid LSTM units. To overcome the problem, we propose Intrinsic Sparse Structures (ISS) in LSTMs. Removing a component of ISS will simultaneously decrease the sizes of all basic structures by one and thereby always maintain the dimension consistency. By learning ISS within LSTM units, the obtained LSTMs remain regular while having much smaller basic structures.

Expanding on the idea of adaptive computation time (ACT), with the use of an elastic gate in the form of a rectified exponentially decreasing function taking on as arguments as previous hidden state and input, the proposed model is able to evaluate the appropriate recurrent depth for each input. The rectified gating function enables the most significant intermediate hidden state updates to come early such that significant performance gain is achieved early. 2) Updating the weights from that of previous intermediate layer offers a richer representation than the use of shared weights across all intermediate recurrence layers. The weight update procedure is just an expansion of the idea underlying hypernetworks. To substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed network, we conducted three experiments: regression on synthetic data, human activity recognition, and language modeling on the Penn Treebank dataset. The proposed networks showed better performance than other state-of-the-art recurrent networks in all three experiments.",100.0,EI-REHN-1000D,Unreleased,Korea (Republic of),,,,,,2025-05-28 16:17,,,,,,Academia,,,,,Unreleased,,Academia,,,FP32,,Operation counting,,,,

core idea is to equip each original convolutional layer
with another low-cost collaborative layer (LCCL), and the
element-wise multiplication of the ReLU outputs of these
two parallel layers produces the layer-wise output. The
combined layer is potentially more discriminative than the
original convolutional layer, and its inference is faster for
two reasons: 1) the zero cells of the LCCL feature maps will
remain zero after element-wise multiplication, and thus it is
safe to skip the calculation of the corresponding high-cost
convolution in the original convolutional layer; 2) LCCL
is very fast if it is implemented as a 1 × 1 convolution or
only a single filter shared by all channels. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ILSCRC-2012

Like a conventional computer, it can use its memory to represent and manipulate complex data structures, but, like a neural network, it can learn to do so from data. When trained with supervised learning, we demonstrate that a DNC can successfully answer synthetic questions designed to emulate reasoning and inference problems in natural language. We show that it can learn tasks such as finding the shortest path between specified points and inferring the missing links in randomly generated graphs, and then generalize these tasks to specific graphs such as transport networks and family trees.

Unfortunately, NMT systems are known to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation inference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words. These issues have hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both accuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google's Neural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder layers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final translation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference computations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited set of common sub-word units (""wordpieces"") for both input and output. This method provides a good balance between the flexibility of ""character""-delimited models and the efficiency of ""word""-delimited models, naturally handles translation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the system. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and uses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that is most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. On the WMT'14 English-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive results to state-of-the-art.

These inefficiencies mostly stem from following an ad hoc procedure. We propose a simple architecture, called SimpleNet, based on a set of designing principles, with which we empirically show, a well-crafted yet simple and reasonably deep architecture can perform on par with deeper and more complex architectures. SimpleNet provides a good tradeoff between the computation/memory efficiency and the accuracy. Our simple 13-layer architecture outperforms most of the deeper and complex architectures to date such as VGGNet, ResNet, and GoogleNet on several well-known benchmarks while having 2 to 25 times fewer number of parameters and operations. This makes it very handy for embedded systems or systems with computational and memory limitations. We achieved state-of-theart result on CIFAR10 outperforming several heavier architectures, near state of the art on MNIST and highly competitive results on CIFAR100 and SVHN.

Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations.

Our system is truly end-to-end, requiring no feature engineering or data preprocessing, thus making it applicable to a wide range of sequence labeling tasks. We evaluate our system on two data sets or two sequence labeling tasks — Penn Treebank WSJ corpus for part-of-speech (POS) tagging and CoNLL 2003 corpus for named entity recognition (NER).

This operator can also be applied to discretized continuous space and time problems, and we provide empirical results evidencing superior performance in this context. Extending the idea of a locally consistent operator, we then derive sufficient conditions for an operator to preserve optimality, leading to a family of operators which includes our consistent Bellman operator. As corollaries we provide a proof of optimality for Baird's advantage learning algorithm and derive other gap-increasing operators with interesting properties.

",NVIDIA GeForce GTX TITAN X,Supervised,Confident,"We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. Our SSD model is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stage and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has comparable accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy, even with a smaller input image size. For 300×300 input, SSD achieves 72.1% mAP on VOC2007 test at 58 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for 500×500 input, SSD achieves 75.1% mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model.

We propose a novel deep learning framework for attribute prediction in the wild. It cascades two CNNs, LNet and ANet, which are fine-tuned jointly with attribute tags, but pre-trained differently. LNet is pre-trained by massive general object categories for face localization, while ANet is pre-trained by massive face identities for attribute prediction. This framework not only outperforms the state-of-the-art with a large margin, but also reveals valuable facts on learning face representation.
(1) It shows how the performances of face localization (LNet) and attribute prediction (ANet) can be improved by different pre-training strategies.
(2) It reveals that although the filters of LNet are fine-tuned only with image-level attribute tags, their response maps over entire images have strong indication of face locations. This fact enables training LNet for face localization with only image-level annotations, but without face bounding boxes or landmarks, which are required by all attribute recognition works.
(3) It also demonstrates that the high-level hidden neurons of ANet automatically discover semantic concepts after pre-training with massive face identities, and such concepts are significantly enriched after fine-tuning with attribute tags. Each attribute can be well explained with a sparse linear combination of these concepts.",,,,"Hong Kong,China",,,,,,2024-11-01 10:03,,,,,,Academia,,,,,,,Academia,,,,,,,,,

Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT'14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on this task. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.",7.5,,,United States of America,,,,,,2025-05-08 16:08,,,,,,Industry,,,,,,,Industry,,,,,"Operation counting,Hardware,Third-party estimation",,,,

another source says WSJ contains 37k sentences, so this would be ~30 words per sentence which seems high but roughly right: https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/1903.00216/",,,,Supervised,Likely,"This paper presents a speech recognition system that directly transcribes audio data with text, without requiring an intermediate phonetic representation. The system is based on a combination of the deep bidirectional LSTM recurrent neural network architecture and the Connectionist Temporal Classification objective function. A modification to the objective function is introduced that trains the network to minimise the expectation of an arbitrary transcription loss function. This allows a direct optimisation of the word error rate, even in the absence of a lexicon or language model. The system achieves a word error rate of 27.3% on the Wall Street Journal corpus with no prior linguistic information, 21.9% with only a lexicon of allowed words, and 8.2% with a trigram language model. Combining the network with a baseline system further reduces the error rate to 6.7%.",,,,"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Canada",,,,,,2025-05-09 11:32,,,,,,"Industry,Academia",,,,,,,"Industry,Academia",,,,,,,,,

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples.

This vector is used to convey contextual information about the sentence being modeled. By performing Latent Dirichlet Allocation using a block of preceding text, we achieve a topic-conditioned RNNLM. This approach has the key advantage of avoiding the data fragmentation associated with building multiple topic models on different data subsets. We report perplexity results on the Penn Treebank data, where we achieve a new state-of-the-art. We further apply the model to the Wall Street Journal speech recognition task, where we observe

However, it provides some relevant information:

In Section 4, it mentions that the learning rates were adapted at the end of each epoch based on the validation set perplexity.

In Section 4.1, it states: ""NCE took about twice as many epochs as ML to converge.""

For maximum likelihood (ML) training, the training time is reported as 21 hours.

So we can deduce:

ML training took 21 hours and NCE took twice as many epochs as ML to converge.

The training was done using mini-batches of 1000 context/word pairs.

Each epoch must have involved passing through the entire 930K word training set.

So as a rough estimate, if we assume epoch time to be proportional to training time, and we know NCE took twice as many epochs:

ML took 21 hours, so approximately 20-25 epochs.
NCE took twice as many, so approximately 40-50 epochs.
Therefore, I would estimate the LBL models were trained for approximately 40-50 epochs. The paper does not provide the exact number.",,,,,Likely,"In spite of their superior performance, neural probabilistic language models (NPLMs) remain far less widely used than n-gram models due to their notoriously long training times, which are measured in weeks even for moderately-sized datasets. Training NPLMs is computationally expensive because they are explicitly normalized, which leads to having to consider all words in the vocabulary when computing the log-likelihood gradients.
We propose a fast and simple algorithm for training NPLMs based on noise-contrastive estimation, a newly introduced procedure for estimating unnormalized continuous distributions. We investigate the behaviour of the algorithm on the Penn Treebank corpus and show that it reduces the training times by more than an order of magnitude without affecting the quality of the resulting models. The algorithm is also more efficient and much more stable than importance sampling because it requires far fewer noise samples to perform well.
We demonstrate the scalability of the proposed approach by training several neural language models on a 47M-word corpus with a 80K-word vocabulary, obtaining state-of-the-art results on the Microsoft Research Sentence Completion Challenge dataset.",45.0,LBL,Unreleased,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,,,,,2025-04-21 12:16,,,,,,Academia,,,,,Unreleased,,Academia,,,,,Operation counting,,,,

They assembled it by searching the web for images of every non-abstract English noun in the lexical database WordNet[15, 8]. They used several search engines, including Google, Flickr, and Altavista and kept roughly the rst 3000 results for each search term. After collecting all the images for a particular search term, they removed perfect duplicates and images in which an excessively large portion of the pixels were white, as they tended to be synthetic gures rather than natural images. The search term used to nd an image provides it with a rough label, although it is extremely unreliable due to the nature of online image search technology.
In total, the dataset contains 80 million colour images downscaled to 32 × 32 and spread out across 79000 search terms. Most of our experiments with unsupervised learning were performed on a subset of about 2 million images.""

We show how to train a multi-layer generative model that learns to extract meaningful features which
resemble those found in the human visual cortex. Using a novel parallelization algorithm to distribute
the work among multiple machines connected on a network, we show how training such a model can be
done in reasonable time.
A second problematic aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels
which makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments. We created two sets of reliable labels.
The CIFAR-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the CIFAR-100 set has 600 examples of

Then, we apply supervised learning to predict the depthmap as a function of the image. Depth estimation is a challenging problem, since local features alone are insufficient to estimate depth at a point, and one needs to consider the global context of the image. Our model uses a discriminatively-trained Markov Random Field (MRF) that incorporates multiscale local- and global-image features, and models both depths at individual points as well as the relation between depths at different points.

The main advantage of these architectures is that they learn an embedding for words (or other symbols) in a continuous space that helps to smooth the language model and provide good generalization even when the number of training examples is insufficient. However, these models are extremely slow in comparison to the more commonly used n-gram models, both for training and recognition. As an alternative to an importance sampling method proposed to speed-up training, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the conditional probabilities that yields a speed-up of about 200 both during training and recognition. The hierarchical decomposition is a binary hierarchical clustering constrained by the prior knowledge extracted from the WordNet semantic hierarchy.",30.0,,,,,,,1.0,,2025-02-19 12:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hardware,,,,

There are two phases in each layer of LMICA. One is the mapping phase, where a one-dimensional mapping is formed by a stochastic gradient algorithm which makes more highly-correlated (non-independent) signals be nearer incrementally. Another is the local-ICA phase, where each neighbor (namely, highly-correlated) pair of signals in the mapping is separated by the MaxKurt algorithm. Because LMICA separates only the highly-correlated pairs instead of all ones, it can extract independent components quite efficiently from appropriate observed signals. In addition, it is proved that LMICA always converges.

We claim that the increased efficiency is due to (1) employing a principled method of crossover of different topologies, (2) protecting structural innovation using speciation, and (3) incrementally growing from minimal structure. We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is significantly faster learning.

The quality of generative models learned in this way can be assessed by learning a separate model for each class of digit and then comparing the unnormalized probabilities of test images under the 10 different class-specific models. To improve discriminative performance, it is helpful to learn a hierarchy of separate models for each digit class. Each model in the hierarchy has one layer of hidden units and the nth level model is trained on data that consists of the activities of the hidden units in the already trained (n - 1)th level model. After training, each level produces a separate, unnormalized log probabilty score. With a three-level hierarchy for each of the 10 digit classes, a test image produces 30 scores which can be used as inputs to a supervised, logistic classification network that is trained on separate data.

The recognition rate on a subset of NIST database 3 is 4.0% higher with LISSOM than with a regular Self-Organizing Map (SOM) as the front end, and 15.8% higher than recognition of raw input bitmaps directly.

A training multilayer fully connected network of ADALINE neurons is proposed as a preprocessing step for invariant image extraction. A second neural network has been trained by the popular backpropagation algorithm for recovering the real image without distortions. First, the sample invariants are obtained by the preprocessing network. In the second step, the general invariant that includes all the sample invariants is computed. Afterward, the reordered sample invariants are input to a multilayer neural network trained by the backpropagation algorithm. The original image, without distortions, is obtained in the output of this system. Several test images have been computed, and evaluation of the results shows that in the case of images with intrinsic perceptual similarity, the learning procedure leads to a global invariant extraction that requires less computational effort in comparison with an arbitrary training selection. After the training process, this system is able to extract the generalized invariant image from an arbitrary picture recovering the input image without distortions.<<ETX>>",,,,Spain,,,,,,2025-02-17 13:32,,,,,,Academia,,,,,,,Academia,,,,,Hardware,,,,

",,,,,5.0,"""Five training patterns used for the self-organization are shown in Fig. 4""",,,,,Speculative,"A hierarchical neural network model with feedback interconnections, which has the function of associative memory and the ability to recognize patterns, is proposed. The model consists of a hierarchical multi-layered network to which efferent connections are added, so as to make positive feedback loops in pairs with afferent connections. The cell-layer at the initial stage of the network is the input layer which receives the stimulus input and at the same time works as an output layer for associative recall. The deepest layer is the output layer for pattern-recognition. Pattern-recognition is performed hierarchically by integrating information by converging afferent paths in the network. For the purpose of associative recall, the integrated information is again distributed to lower-order cells by diverging efferent paths. These two operations progress simultaneously in the network. If a fragment of a training pattern is presented to the network which has completed its self-organization, the entire pattern will gradually be recalled in the initial layer. If a stimulus consisting of a number of training patterns superposed is presented, one pattern gradually becomes predominant in the recalled output after competition between the patterns, and the others disappear. At about the same time when the recalled pattern reaches a steady state in he initial layer, in the deepest layer of the network, a response is elicited from the cell corresponding to the category of the finally-recalled pattern. Once a steady state has been reached, the response of the network is automatically extinguished by inhibitory signals from a steadiness-detecting cell. If the same stimulus is still presented after inhibition, a response for another pattern, formerly suppressed, will now appear, because the cells of the network have adaptation characteristics which makes the same response unlikely to recur. Since inhibition occurs repeatedly, the superposed input patterns are recalled one by one in turn.",,,,Japan,,,,,,2024-09-05 14:08,,,,,,Industry,,,,,,,Industry,,,,,,,,,

In the course of learning to balance the pole, the ASE constructs associations between input and output by searching under the influence of reinforcement feedback, and the ACE constructs a more informative evaluation function than reinforcement feedback alone can provide.

The best result was obtained so far by successive dichotomies based on the principle of the logical decision tree. First the normal patterns and the abnormal patterns were divided.

Next the abnormal cases were divided into two groups depending on whether the QRS duration was more than 0.12 seconds or less.

Various properties of linear decision functions are discussed. One such property is that a linear decision function is guaranteed to perform at least as well as a minimum distance categorizer.

At the present time the memory tape contains something over 53,000 board positions (averaging 3.8 word search) which have been selected from a much larger
number of positions by means of the culling techniques
described. While this is still far from the number which
would tax the listing and searching procedures used in
the program, rough estimates, based on the frequency
with which the saved boards are utilized during normal
play (these figures being tabulated automatically), indicate that a library tape containing at least 20 times the
present number of board positions would be needed to
improve the midgame play significantly. At the present
rate of acquisition of new positions this would require
an inordinate amount of play and, consequently, of
machine time.",,,,,Likely,,,,,United States of America,,,,,,2025-06-16 05:05,,,,,,Industry,,,,,,,Industry,,,,,,,,,

The photograph on the left shows how the inputs were obtained using a simple camera system in which an input scene, in this case a printed character, was illuminated by powerful lights, and an image focussed onto a 20 × 20 array of cadmium sulphide photocells, giving a primitive 400 pixel image. The perceptron also had a patch board, shown in the middle photograph, which allowed different configurations of input features to be tried. Often these were wired up at random to demonstrate the ability of the perceptron to learn without the need for precise wiring, in contrast to a modern digital computer. The photograph on the right shows one of the racks of adaptive weights. Each weight was implemented using a rotary variable resistor, also called a potentiometer, driven by an electric motor thereby allowing the value of the weight to be adjusted automatically by the learning algorithm.""

The team is led by Professor Rio Yokota of Tokyo Institute of Technology, Associate Professor Keisuke Sakaguchi of Tohoku University, Koichi Shirahata of Fujitsu Limited, Team Leader Mohamed Wahib of RIKEN, Associate Professor Koji Nishiguchi of Nagoya University, Shota Sasaki of CyberAgent, Inc, and Noriyuki Kojima of Kotoba Technologies Inc.

To train large language models on Fugaku, the researchers developed distributed training methods, including porting the deep learning framework Megatron-DeepSpeed to Fugaku in order to optimize the performance of Transformers on Fugaku. They accelerated the dense matrix multiplication library for Transformers, and optimized communication performance for Fugaku by combining three types of parallelization techniques and accelerated the collective communication library on the Tofu interconnect D.

Fugaku-LLM has 13 billion parameters (2) and is larger than the 7-billion-parameter models that have been developed widely in Japan. Fugaku-LLM has enhanced Japanese capabilities, with an average score of 5.5 on the Japanese MT-Bench (3), the highest performance among open models that are trained using original data produced in Japan. In particular, the benchmark performance for humanities and social sciences tasks reached a remarkably high score of 9.18.

Fugaku-LLM was trained on proprietary Japanese data collected by CyberAgent, along with English data, and other data. The source code of Fugaku-LLM is available on GitHub (4) and the model is available on Hugging Face (5). Fugaku-LLM can be used for research and commercial purposes as long as users comply with the license.

In the future, as more researchers and engineers participate in improving the models and their applications, the efficiency of training will be improved, leading to next-generation innovative research and business applications, such as the linkage of scientific simulation and generative AI, and social simulation of virtual communities with thousands of AIs.",2024-05-13 10:04,Robi Rahman,,,"Japan,Japan",,,,,,,,,,,,"Academia,Industry",,,,,,,,"Academia,Industry",,,

The family includes two new models: (1) an updated Gemini 1.5 Pro, which exceeds the February version on the great majority of capabilities and benchmarks; (2) Gemini 1.5 Flash, a more lightweight variant designed for efficiency with minimal regression in quality. Gemini 1.5 models achieve near-perfect recall on long-context retrieval tasks across modalities, improve the state-of-the-art in long-document QA, long-video QA and long-context ASR, and match or surpass Gemini 1.0 Ultra’s state-of-the-art performance across a broad set of benchmarks. Studying the limits of Gemini 1.5’s long-context ability, we find continued improvement in next-token prediction and near-perfect retrieval (>99%) up to at least 10M tokens, a generational leap over existing models such as Claude 3.0 (200k) and GPT-4 Turbo (128k). Finally, we highlight real-world use cases, such as Gemini 1.5 collaborating with professions on their completing their tasks achieving 26 to 75% time savings across 10 different job categories, as well as surprising new capabilities of large language models at the frontier; when given a grammar manual for Kalamang, a language with fewer than 200 speakers worldwide, the model learns to translate English to Kalamang at a similar level to a person who learned from the same content.

Our method enforces a total compute budget by capping the number of tokens (k) that can participate in the self-attention and MLP computations at a given layer. The tokens to be processed are determined by the network using a top-k routing mechanism. Since k is defined a priori, this simple procedure uses a static computation graph with known tensor sizes, unlike other conditional computation techniques. Nevertheless, since the identities of the k tokens are fluid, this method can expend FLOPs non-uniformly across the time and model depth dimensions. Thus, compute expenditure is entirely predictable in sum total, but dynamic and context-sensitive at the token-level. Not only do models trained in this way learn to dynamically allocate compute, they do so efficiently. These models match baseline performance for equivalent FLOPS and wall-clock times to train, but require a fraction of the FLOPs per forward pass, and can be upwards of 50\% faster to step during post-training sampling.",2024-05-24 14:17,Anonymous,,0,"Multinational,Canada,Canada",,,,,,,,,,,,"Industry,Academia,Academia",,,,,,,,"Industry,Academia,Academia",,,

For example, we demonstrate that for large-scale multimodal pre-training using a careful mix of image-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) few-shot results across multiple benchmarks, compared to other published pre-training results. Further, we show that the image encoder together with image resolution and the image token count has substantial impact, while the vision-language connector design is of comparatively negligible importance.

Consequently, these models lack the ability to effectively understand the fine-grained details of input data, limiting their performance in tasks that require a more nuanced understanding. To address this limitation, there is a compelling need to develop models that enable fine-grained understanding across multiple modalities, thereby enhancing their applicability to a wide range of tasks.

It demonstrates precise identification and localization of specific regions in images or moments in videos.

However, conventional MoE architectures like GShard, which activate the top-K out of N experts, face challenges in ensuring expert specialization, i.e. each expert acquires non-overlapping and focused knowledge. In response, we propose the DeepSeekMoE architecture towards ultimate expert specialization. It involves two principal strategies: (1) finely segmenting the experts into mN ones and activating mK from them, allowing for a more flexible combination of activated experts; (2) isolating Ks experts as shared ones, aiming at capturing common knowledge and mitigating redundancy in routed experts. Starting from a modest scale with 2B parameters, we demonstrate that DeepSeekMoE 2B achieves comparable performance with GShard 2.9B, which has 1.5 times the expert parameters and computation. In addition, DeepSeekMoE 2B nearly approaches the performance of its dense counterpart with the same number of total parameters, which set the upper bound of MoE models. Subsequently, we scale up DeepSeekMoE to 16B parameters and show that it achieves comparable performance with LLaMA2 7B, with only about 40% of computations. Further, our preliminary efforts to scale up DeepSeekMoE to 145B parameters consistently validate its substantial advantages over the GShard architecture, and show its performance comparable with DeepSeek 67B, using only 28.5% (maybe even 18.2%) of computations.",2024-04-16 16:29,Anonymous,,0,China,,,,,,,,,,,,Industry,,,,,,,abuse restrictions: https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-MoE/blob/main/LICENSE-MODEL,Industry,,,

Applying FunSearch to a central problem in extremal combinatorics—the cap set problem—we discover new constructions of large cap sets going beyond the best-known ones, both in finite dimensional and asymptotic cases. This shows that it is possible to make discoveries for established open problems using LLMs. We showcase the generality of FunSearch by applying it to an algorithmic problem, online bin packing, finding new heuristics that improve on widely used baselines. In contrast to most computer search approaches, FunSearch searches for programs that describe how to solve a problem, rather than what the solution is. Beyond being an effective and scalable strategy, discovered programs tend to be more interpretable than raw solutions, enabling feedback loops between domain experts and FunSearch, and the deployment of such programs in real-world applications.",2024-04-18 20:49,Anonymous,,0,Multinational,PaLM 2,0,No finetuning,,,,,,,,,Industry,,,,,,,"Code to run FunSearch with an LLM of your choice is open source under Apache 2.0 (software) and CC-BY (all else).

SeamlessExpressive enables translation that preserves vocal styles and prosody. Compared to previous efforts in expressive speech research, our work addresses certain underexplored aspects of prosody, such as speech rate and pauses, while also preserving the style of one's voice. As for SeamlessStreaming, our model leverages the Efficient Monotonic Multihead Attention mechanism to generate low-latency target translations without waiting for complete source utterances. As the first of its kind, SeamlessStreaming enables simultaneous speech-to-speech/text translation for multiple source and target languages. To ensure that our models can be used safely and responsibly, we implemented the first known red-teaming effort for multimodal machine translation, a system for the detection and mitigation of added toxicity, a systematic evaluation of gender bias, and an inaudible localized watermarking mechanism designed to dampen the impact of deepfakes.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,Likely,"Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with maintaining accuracy across a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps in mathematical reasoning, leading to error propagation that undermines the final result. The current methodology to mitigate this issue primarily involves using a verifier model to assess the correctness of generated solution candidates, focusing either on the overall reasoning path or on an incomplete reasoning path. By rethinking this approach, we argue that assessing potentials of incomplete reasoning paths could be more advantageous as it guides towards correct final answers, transforming the task into a \textit{planning} problem. Our proposed verifier, the Outcome-supervision Value Model (OVM), employs outcome supervision for training, offering an efficient and intuitive method for \textit{planning} by prioritizing steps that lead to accurate conclusions over mere per-step correctness.

However, the absence of pre-trained audio models capable of handling diverse audio types and tasks has hindered progress in this field.

In this paper, we develop the Qwen-Audio model and address this limitation by scaling up audio-language pre-training to cover over 30 tasks and various audio types, such as human speech, natural sounds, music, and songs, to facilitate universal audio understanding abilities. However, directly co-training all tasks and datasets can lead to interference issues, as the textual labels associated with different datasets exhibit considerable variations due to differences in task focus, language, granularity of annotation, and text structure. To overcome the one-to-many interference, we carefully design a multi-task training framework by conditioning on a sequence of hierarchical tags to the decoder for encouraging knowledge sharing and avoiding interference through shared and specified tags respectively. Remarkably, Qwen-Audio achieves impressive performance across diverse benchmark tasks without requiring any task-specific fine-tuning, surpassing its counterparts. Building upon the capabilities of Qwen-Audio, we further develop Qwen-Audio-Chat, which allows for input from various audios and text inputs, enabling multi-turn dialogues and supporting various audio-central scenarios.

By directly integrating the weights from two domains, the mixed LLM can efficiently incorporate diverse semantics with favorable robustness.

While recently proposed approaches show promise in generalization to novel objects, semantic concepts, or visual distribution shifts, generalization to new tasks remains challenging. For example, a language-conditioned policy trained on pick-and-place tasks will not be able to generalize to a folding task, even if the arm trajectory of folding is similar to pick-and-place. Our key insight is that this kind of generalization becomes feasible if we represent the task through rough trajectory sketches. We propose a policy conditioning method using such rough trajectory sketches, which we call RT-Trajectory, that is practical, easy to specify, and allows the policy to effectively perform new tasks that would otherwise be challenging to perform. We find that trajectory sketches strike a balance between being detailed enough to express low-level motion-centric guidance while being coarse enough to allow the learned policy to interpret the trajectory sketch in the context of situational visual observations. In addition, we show how trajectory sketches can provide a useful interface to communicate with robotic policies: they can be specified through simple human inputs like drawings or videos, or through automated methods such as modern image-generating or waypoint-generating methods. We evaluate RT-Trajectory at scale on a variety of real-world robotic tasks, and find that RT-Trajectory is able to perform a wider range of tasks compared to language-conditioned and goal-conditioned policies, when provided the same training data.",2024-05-21 14:05,Anonymous,,0,"Multinational,United States of America,United States of America",,,,,,,,,,,,"Industry,Academia,Academia",,,,,,,,"Industry,Academia,Academia",,,

In this paper, we present a solution to this memory problem, in form of a new compression and execution framework called QMoE. Specifically, QMoE consists of a scalable algorithm which accurately compresses trillion-parameter MoEs to less than 1 bit per parameter, in a custom format co-designed with bespoke GPU decoding kernels to facilitate efficient end-to-end compressed inference, with minor runtime overheads relative to uncompressed execution. Concretely, QMoE can compress the 1.6 trillion parameter SwitchTransformer-c2048 model to less than 160GB (20x compression, 0.8 bits per parameter) at only minor accuracy loss, in less than a day on a single GPU.

address this by training a bespoke image captioner and use it to recaption the

on these synthetic captions reliably improves prompt following ability. Finally, we
use these findings to build DALL-E 3: a new text-to-image generation system, and
benchmark its performance on an evaluation designed to measure prompt following, coherence, and aesthetics, finding that it compares favorably to competitors.

The results demonstrate that CodeFuse-13B achieves a HumanEval pass@1 score of 37.10%, positioning it as one of the top multi-lingual code LLMs with similar parameter sizes.

Following training on structures of full biological assemblies in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), RFAA has comparable protein structure prediction accuracy to AF2, excellent performance in CAMEO for flexible backbone small molecule docking, and reasonable prediction accuracy for protein covalent modifications and assemblies of proteins with multiple nucleic acid chains and small molecules which, to our knowledge, no existing method can model simultaneously.

It includes Qwen, the base pretrained language models, and Qwen-Chat, the chat models finetuned with human alignment techniques. The base language models consistently demonstrate superior performance across a multitude of downstream tasks, and the chat models, particularly those trained using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are highly competitive. The chat models possess advanced tool-use and planning capabilities for creating agent applications, showcasing impressive performance even when compared to bigger models on complex tasks like utilizing a code interpreter. Furthermore, we have developed coding-specialized models, Code-Qwen and Code-Qwen-Chat, as well as mathematics-focused models, Math-Qwen-Chat, which are built upon base language models.

As such, sparse MoEs have enabled unprecedented scalability, resulting in tremendous successes across domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. In this work, we instead explore the use of sparse MoEs to scale-down Vision Transformers (ViTs) to make them more attractive for resource-constrained vision applications. To this end, we propose a simplified and mobile-friendly MoE design where entire images rather than individual patches are routed to the experts. We also propose a stable MoE training procedure that uses super-class information to guide the router. We empirically show that our sparse Mobile Vision MoEs (V-MoEs) can achieve a better trade-off between performance and efficiency than the corresponding dense ViTs. For example, for the ViT-Tiny model, our Mobile V-MoE outperforms its dense counterpart by 3.39% on ImageNet-1k.

To this end, we propose to co-fine-tune state-of-the-art vision-language models on both robotic trajectory data and Internet-scale vision-language tasks, such as visual question answering. In contrast to other approaches, we propose a simple, general recipe to achieve this goal: in order to fit both natural language responses and robotic actions into the same format, we express the actions as text tokens and incorporate them directly into the training set of the model in the same way as natural language tokens. We refer to such category of models as vision-language-action models (VLA) and instantiate an example of such a model, which we call RT-2. Our extensive evaluation (6k evaluation trials) shows that our approach leads to performant robotic policies and enables RT-2 to obtain a range of emergent capabilities from Internet-scale training. This includes significantly improved generalization to novel objects, the ability to interpret commands not present in the robot training data (such as placing an object onto a particular number or icon), and the ability to perform rudimentary reasoning in response to user commands (such as picking up the smallest or largest object, or the one closest to another object). We further show that incorporating chain of thought reasoning allows RT-2 to perform multi-stage semantic reasoning, for example figuring out which object to pick up for use as an improvised hammer (a rock), or which type of drink is best suited for someone who is tired (an energy drink).",2024-05-01 10:22,Anonymous,,0,Multinational,PaLI-X,,"""For RT-2-PaLI-X-55B, we use learning rate 1e-3 and batch size 2048 and co-fine-tune the model for 80K gradient steps""

Namely, we leverage the discretized activations of a masked language model pre-trained on audio to capture long-term structure and the discrete codes produced by a neural audio codec to achieve high-quality synthesis. By training on large corpora of raw audio waveforms, AudioLM learns to generate natural and coherent continuations given short prompts. When trained on speech, and without any transcript or annotation, AudioLM generates syntactically and semantically plausible speech continuations while also maintaining speaker identity and prosody for unseen speakers. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our approach extends beyond speech by generating coherent piano music continuations, despite being trained without any symbolic representation of music.",2024-05-01 10:22,Anonymous,,0,United States of America,,,,,,,,,,,,Industry,checked,,,,,,,Industry,,,

The chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear complexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly while recurrently summarizing the chunks.

However, existing methods struggle with either computational complexity or model expressivity, rendering the maximum sequence length restricted. To address this issue, we introduce LongNet, a Transformer variant that can scale sequence length to more than 1 billion tokens, without sacrificing the performance on shorter sequences. Specifically, we propose dilated attention, which expands the attentive field exponentially as the distance grows. LongNet has significant advantages: 1) it has a linear computation complexity and a logarithm dependency between any two tokens in a sequence; 2) it can be served as a distributed trainer for extremely long sequences; 3) its dilated attention is a drop-in replacement for standard attention, which can be seamlessly integrated with the existing Transformer-based optimization. Experiments results demonstrate that LongNet yields strong performance on both long-sequence modeling and general language tasks. Our work opens up new possibilities for modeling very long sequences, e.g., treating a whole corpus or even the entire Internet as a sequence.",2024-05-24 19:58,Anonymous,,0,"United States of America,China",,,,,,,,,,,,"Industry,Academia",,,,,,,,"Industry,Academia",,,

Similar to natural language models, researchers have proposed foundation models in genomics to learn generalizable features from unlabeled genome data that can then be fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as identifying regulatory elements. Due to the quadratic scaling of attention, previous Transformer-based genomic models have used 512 to 4k tokens as context (<0.001% of the human genome), significantly limiting the modeling of long-range interactions in DNA. In addition, these methods rely on tokenizers or fixed k-mers to aggregate meaningful DNA units, losing single nucleotide resolution where subtle genetic variations can completely alter protein function via single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Recently, Hyena, a large language model based on implicit convolutions was shown to match attention in quality while allowing longer context lengths and lower time complexity. Leveraging Hyena's new long-range capabilities, we present HyenaDNA, a genomic foundation model pretrained on the human reference genome with context lengths of up to 1 million tokens at the single nucleotide-level - an up to 500x increase over previous dense attention-based models. HyenaDNA scales sub-quadratically in sequence length (training up to 160x faster than Transformer), uses single nucleotide tokens, and has full global context at each layer. We explore what longer context enables - including the first use of in-context learning in genomics.

We do this by drawing on arguably the most comprehensive registry data in existence, available for an entire nation of more than six million individuals across decades.

We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of Transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, which parallelizes computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference, leading to the first non-transformer architecture to be scaled to tens of billions of parameters. Our experiments reveal that RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting that future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models.

However, existing code LLMs have two main limitations in terms of architecture and pretraining tasks. First, they often adopt a specific architecture (encoder-only or decoder-only) or rely on a unified encoder-decoder network for different downstream tasks. The former paradigm is limited by inflexibility in applications while in the latter, the model is treated as a single system for all tasks, leading to suboptimal performance on a subset of tasks. Secondly, they often employ a limited set of pretraining objectives which might not be relevant to some downstream tasks and hence result in substantial performance degrade. To address these limitations, we propose ``CodeT5+'', a family of encoder-decoder LLMs for code in which component modules can be flexibly combined to suit a wide range of downstream code tasks. Such flexibility is enabled by our proposed mixture of pretraining objectives to mitigate the pretrain-finetune discrepancy. These objectives cover span denoising, contrastive learning, text-code matching, and causal LM pretraining tasks, on both unimodal and bimodal multilingual code corpora.

The quality of the learned representations appears to be dictated by the neural scaling laws as a function of the number of model parameters and observations, while imposing upper bounds on the model performance by the amount of available data and compute, which is costly.
In this study, we attempt to render the training of LLMs for program synthesis more efficient by unifying four key components: (1) model architectures, (2) learning methods, (3) infill sampling, and, (4) data distributions. Specifically, for the model architecture, we attempt to unify encoder and decoder-based models into a single prefix-LM. For learning methods, (i) causal language modeling, (ii) span corruption, (iii) infilling are unified into a simple learning algorithm. For infill sampling, we explore the claim of a ""free lunch"" hypothesis. For data distributions, the effect of a mixture distribution and multi-epoch training of programming and natural languages on model performance is explored.
We conduct a comprehensive series of empirical experiments on 1B LLMs, for which failures and successes of this exploration are distilled into five lessons.

We present Perfusion, a T2I personalization method that addresses these challenges using dynamic rank-1 updates to the underlying T2I model. Perfusion avoids overfitting by introducing a new mechanism that ""locks"" new concepts' cross-attention Keys to their superordinate category. Additionally, we develop a gated rank-1 approach that enables us to control the influence of a learned concept during inference time and to combine multiple concepts. This allows runtime-efficient balancing of visual-fidelity and textual-alignment with a single 100KB trained model, which is five orders of magnitude smaller than the current state of the art. Moreover, it can span different operating points across the Pareto front without additional training.

We first trained individual skills in isolation and then composed those skills end-to-end in a self-play setting. The resulting policy exhibits robust and dynamic movement skills such as rapid fall recovery, walking, turning, kicking and more; and transitions between them in a smooth, stable, and efficient manner - well beyond what is intuitively expected from the robot. The agents also developed a basic strategic understanding of the game, and learned, for instance, to anticipate ball movements and to block opponent shots. The full range of behaviors emerged from a small set of simple rewards. Our agents were trained in simulation and transferred to real robots zero-shot. We found that a combination of sufficiently high-frequency control, targeted dynamics randomization, and perturbations during training in simulation enabled good-quality transfer, despite significant unmodeled effects and variations across robot instances. Although the robots are inherently fragile, minor hardware modifications together with basic regularization of the behavior during training led the robots to learn safe and effective movements while still performing in a dynamic and agile way. Indeed, even though the agents were optimized for scoring, in experiments they walked 156% faster, took 63% less time to get up, and kicked 24% faster than a scripted baseline, while efficiently combining the skills to achieve the longer term objectives.

Machine learning has shown promise in learning latent relationships underlying the sequence-structure-function paradigm from massive protein sequence datasets. However, to date, limited attempts have been made in extending this continuum to include higher order genomic context information. Evolutionary processes dictate the specificity of genomic contexts in which a gene is found across phylogenetic distances, and these emergent genomic patterns can be leveraged to uncover functional relationships between gene products. Here, we trained a genomic language model (gLM) on millions of metagenomic scaffolds to learn the latent functional and regulatory relationships between genes. gLM learns contextualized protein embeddings that capture the genomic context as well as the protein sequence itself, and appears to encode biologically meaningful and functionally relevant information (e.g. phylogeny, enzymatic function). Our analysis of the attention patterns demonstrates that gLM is learning co-regulated functional modules (i.e. operons). Our findings illustrate that gLM’s unsupervised deep learning of the metagenomic corpus is an effective approach to encode functional semantics and regulatory syntax of genes in their genomic contexts, providing a promising avenue for uncovering complex relationships between  genes in a genomic region.",2024-04-02 16:48,Anonymous,,,United States of America,ESM2-650M,,,,,,,,,,,Academia,,,,,Open access (non-commercial),Open access (non-commercial),"non-commercial license

We scale the VideoMAE in both model and data with a core design. Specifically, we present a dual masking strategy for efficient pre-training, with an encoder operating on a subset of video tokens and a decoder processing another subset of video tokens. Although VideoMAE is very efficient due to high masking ratio in encoder, masking decoder can still further reduce the overall computational cost. This enables the efficient pre-training of billion-level models in video.

In this work, we propose AaudioGen, an auto-regressive generative model that generates audio samples conditioned on text inputs. AudioGen operates on a learnt discrete audio representation. The task of text-to-audio generation poses multiple challenges. Due to the way audio travels through a medium, differentiating ``objects'' can be a difficult task (e.g., separating multiple people simultaneously speaking). This is further complicated by real-world recording conditions (e.g., background noise, reverberation, etc.). Scarce text annotations impose another constraint, limiting the ability to scale models. Finally, modeling high-fidelity audio requires encoding audio at high sampling rate, leading to extremely long sequences. To alleviate the aforementioned challenges we propose an augmentation technique that mixes different audio samples, driving the model to internally learn to separate multiple sources. We curated 10 datasets containing different types of audio and text annotations to handle the scarcity of text-audio data points. For faster inference, we explore the use of multi-stream modeling, allowing the use of shorter sequences while maintaining a similar bitrate and perceptual quality. We apply classifier-free guidance to improve adherence to text. Comparing to the evaluated baselines, AudioGen outperforms over both objective and subjective metrics. Finally, we explore the ability of the proposed method to generate audio continuation conditionally and unconditionally.

We find strong evidence in support of this hypothesis across three different experiments, each of which reveal different facets of moral self-correction. We find that the capability for moral self-correction emerges at 22B model parameters, and typically improves with increasing model size and RLHF training. We believe that at this level of scale, language models obtain two capabilities that they can use for moral self-correction: (1) they can follow instructions and (2) they can learn complex normative concepts of harm like stereotyping, bias, and discrimination. As such, they can follow instructions to avoid certain kinds of morally harmful outputs.

Our method discovers a simple and effective optimization algorithm, Lion (EvoLved Sign Momentum). It is more memory-efficient than Adam as it only keeps track of the momentum. Different from adaptive optimizers, its update has the same magnitude for each parameter calculated through the sign operation. We compare Lion with widely used optimizers, such as Adam and Adafactor, for training a variety of models on different tasks. On image classification, Lion boosts the accuracy of ViT by up to 2% on ImageNet and saves up to 5x the pre-training compute on JFT. On vision-language contrastive learning, we achieve 88.3% zero-shot and 91.1% fine-tuning accuracy on ImageNet, surpassing the previous best results by 2% and 0.1%, respectively. On diffusion models, Lion outperforms Adam by achieving a better FID score and reducing the training compute by up to 2.3x. For autoregressive, masked language modeling, and fine-tuning, Lion exhibits a similar or better performance compared to Adam. Our analysis of Lion reveals that its performance gain grows with the training batch size.

ActiveLR, thus, alleviates the need for hyper-parameter search for two of the most commonly tuned hyper-parameters that require heavy time and computational costs to pick. We encourage AI researchers and practitioners to use the Active variant of their optimizer of choice for faster training, better generalizability, and reducing carbon footprint of training deep neural networks.",2024-05-22 13:41,Robi Rahman,mini-GPT-2+Active-AdamW,1,Canada,,,,,,,,,,,,Academia,,,,,Unreleased,,,Academia,,,

In a vast space of held-out environment dynamics, our adaptive agent (AdA) displays on-the-fly hypothesis-driven exploration, efficient exploitation of acquired knowledge, and can successfully be prompted with first-person demonstrations. Adaptation emerges from three ingredients: (1) meta-reinforcement learning across a vast, smooth and diverse task distribution, (2) a policy parameterised as a large-scale attention-based memory architecture, and (3) an effective automated curriculum that prioritises tasks at the frontier of an agent's capabilities.

Although there are already many deep learning methods for predicting the sequence specificities of DBPs, they face two challenges as follows. Classic deep learning methods for DBPs prediction usually fail to capture the dependencies between genomic sequences since their commonly used one-hot codes are mutually orthogonal. Besides, these methods usually perform poorly when samples are inadequate. To address these two challenges, we developed a novel language model for mining DBPs using human genomic data and ChIP-seq datasets with decaying learning rates, named DNA Fine-tuned Language Model (DFLM). It can capture the dependencies between genome sequences based on the context of human genomic data and then fine-tune the features of DBPs tasks using different ChIP-seq datasets. First, we compared DFLM with the existing widely used methods on 69 datasets and we achieved excellent performance. Moreover, we conducted comparative experiments on complex DBPs and small datasets. The results show that DFLM still achieved a significant improvement. Finally, through visualization analysis of one-hot encoding and DFLM, we found that one-hot encoding completely cut off the dependencies of DNA sequences themselves, while DFLM using language models can well represent the dependency of DNA sequences.

However, there is a limited understanding of the performance trade-offs of different decisions made during the instruction-tuning process. These decisions include the scale and diversity of the instruction-tuning benchmark, different task sampling strategies, fine-tuning with and without demonstrations, training using specialized datasets for reasoning and dialogue, and finally, the fine-tuning objectives themselves. In this paper, we characterize the effect of instruction-tuning decisions on downstream task performance when scaling both model and benchmark sizes. To this end, we create OPT-IML Bench: a large benchmark for Instruction Meta-Learning (IML) of 2000 NLP tasks consolidated into task categories from 8 existing benchmarks, and prepare an evaluation framework to measure three types of model generalizations: to tasks from fully held-out categories, to held-out tasks from seen categories, and to held-out instances from seen tasks. Through the lens of this framework, we first present insights about instruction-tuning decisions as applied to OPT-30B and further exploit these insights to train OPT-IML 30B and 175B, which are instruction-tuned versions of OPT. OPT-IML demonstrates all three generalization abilities at both scales on four different evaluation benchmarks with diverse tasks and input formats -- PromptSource, FLAN, Super-NaturalInstructions, and UnifiedSKG.

While this capability has been demonstrated in other fields such as computer vision, natural language processing or speech recognition, it remains to be shown in robotics, where the generalization capabilities of the models are particularly critical due to the difficulty of collecting real-world robotic data. We argue that one of the keys to the success of such general robotic models lies with open-ended task-agnostic training, combined with high-capacity architectures that can absorb all of the diverse, robotic data. In this paper, we present a model class, dubbed Robotics Transformer, that exhibits promising scalable model properties.

but high computational costs and reliance on large training
datasets restrict their deployment in resource-constrained settings. Low-rank approximation of model weights has been
effective in compressing CNN models, but its application
to transformers has been less explored and is less effective. Existing methods require the complete dataset to finetune compressed models, which are both time-consuming and
data-hungry. This paper reveals that the features (i.e., activations) are low-rank, but model weights are surprisingly not
low-rank. Hence, AAFM is proposed, which adaptively determines the compressed model structure and locally compresses each linear layer’s output features rather than the
model weights. A second stage, GFM, optimizes the entire
compressed network holistically. Both AAFM and GFM only
use few training samples without labels, that is, they are fewshot, unsupervised, fast and effective. For example, with only
2K images without labels, 33% of the parameters are removed
in DeiT-B with 18.8% relative throughput increase, but only a
0.23% accuracy loss for ImageNet recognition. The proposed
methods are successfully applied to the language modeling

Starting from random noise, such text-to-image diffusion models gradually synthesize images in an iterative fashion while conditioning on text prompts. We find that their synthesis behavior qualitatively changes throughout this process: Early in sampling, generation strongly relies on the text prompt to generate text-aligned content, while later, the text conditioning is almost entirely ignored. This suggests that sharing model parameters throughout the entire generation process may not be ideal. Therefore, in contrast to existing works, we propose to train an ensemble of text-to-image diffusion models specialized for different synthesis stages. To maintain training efficiency, we initially train a single model, which is then split into specialized models that are trained for the specific stages of the iterative generation process. Our ensemble of diffusion models, called eDiff-I, results in improved text alignment while maintaining the same inference computation cost and preserving high visual quality, outperforming previous large-scale text-to-image diffusion models on the standard benchmark. In addition, we train our model to exploit a variety of embeddings for conditioning, including the T5 text, CLIP text, and CLIP image embeddings. We show that these different embeddings lead to different behaviors. Notably, the CLIP image embedding allows an intuitive way of transferring the style of a reference image to the target text-to-image output. Lastly, we show a technique that enables eDiff-I's ""paint-with-words"" capability. A user can select the word in the input text and paint it in a canvas to control the output, which is very handy for crafting the desired image in mind.

With this observation, we propose to learn a neural LM that fits the residual between an n-gram LM and the real-data distribution. The combination of n-gram and neural LMs not only allows the neural part to focus on the deeper understanding of language but also provides a flexible way to customize an LM by switching the underlying n-gram model without changing the neural model. Experimental results on three typical language tasks (i.e., language modeling, machine translation, and summarization) demonstrate that our approach attains additional performance gains over popular standalone neural models consistently.

In this paper we explore instruction finetuning with a particular focus on (1) scaling the number of tasks, (2) scaling the model size, and (3) finetuning on chain-of-thought data. We find that instruction finetuning with the above aspects dramatically improves performance on a variety of model classes (PaLM, T5, U-PaLM), prompting setups (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT), and evaluation benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, TyDiQA, MGSM, open-ended generation).

Flan-PaLM 540B achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, such as 75.2% on five-shot MMLU.

A major drawback of these models is their size in terms of the number of parameters needed to be fitted and the amount of computational resources they require. Recently, 'distilled' models using the concept of student and teacher networks have been widely used in NLP. Here, we adapted this concept to the problem of protein sequence analysis, by developing DistilProtBert, a distilled version of the successful ProtBert model. Implementing this approach, we reduced the size of the network and the running time by 50%, and the computational resources needed for pretraining by 98% relative to ProtBert model. Using two published tasks, we showed that the performance of the distilled model approaches that of the full model. We next tested the ability of DistilProtBert to distinguish between real and random protein sequences. The task is highly challenging if the composition is maintained on the level of singlet, doublet and triplet amino acids. Indeed, traditional machine-learning algorithms have difficulties with this task.

Such knowledge could be extremely useful to robots aiming to act upon high-level, temporally extended instructions expressed in natural language. However, a significant weakness of language models is that they lack real-world experience, which makes it difficult to leverage them for decision making within a given embodiment. For example, asking a language model to describe how to clean a spill might result in a reasonable narrative, but it may not be applicable to a particular agent, such as a robot, that needs to perform this task in a particular environment. We propose to provide real-world grounding by means of pretrained skills, which are used to constrain the model to propose natural language actions that are both feasible and contextually appropriate. The robot can act as the language model's ""hands and eyes,"" while the language model supplies high-level semantic knowledge about the task. We show how low-level skills can be combined with large language models so that the language model provides high-level knowledge about the procedures for performing complex and temporally-extended instructions, while value functions associated with these skills provide the grounding necessary to connect this knowledge to a particular physical environment. We evaluate our method on a number of real-world robotic tasks, where we show the need for real-world grounding and that this approach is capable of completing long-horizon, abstract, natural language instructions on a mobile manipulator.

Yet, teaching morality to machines is a formidable task, as morality remains among the most intensely debated questions in humanity, let alone for AI. Existing AI systems deployed to millions of users, however, are already making decisions loaded with moral implications, which poses a seemingly impossible challenge: teaching machines moral sense, while humanity continues to grapple with it.
To explore this challenge, we introduce Delphi, an experimental framework based on deep neural networks trained directly to reason about descriptive ethical judgments, e.g., ""helping a friend"" is generally good, while ""helping a friend spread fake news"" is not. Empirical results shed novel insights on the promises and limits of machine ethics; Delphi demonstrates strong generalization capabilities in the face of novel ethical situations, while off-the-shelf neural network models exhibit markedly poor judgment including unjust biases, confirming the need for explicitly teaching machines moral sense.
Yet, Delphi is not perfect, exhibiting susceptibility to pervasive biases and inconsistencies. Despite that, we demonstrate positive use cases of imperfect Delphi, including using it as a component model within other imperfect AI systems. Importantly, we interpret the operationalization of Delphi in light of prominent ethical theories, which leads us to important future research questions.",2024-05-08 06:05,Natalia Martemianova,,,"United States of America,United States of America",Unicorn,1689600000000000000,'=6*11B*400k gradient updates*16 (batch size)*4 epochs=1.6896 × 10^18,,,,,,,16,,"Research collective,Academia",,,,,,,https://delphi.allenai.org/,"Research collective,Academia",,,

However, such efforts have coalesced around a small subset of languages, leaving behind the vast majority of mostly low-resource languages. What does it take to break the 200 language barrier while ensuring safe, high quality results, all while keeping ethical considerations in mind? In No Language Left Behind, we took on this challenge by first contextualizing the need for low-resource language translation support through exploratory interviews with native speakers. Then, we created datasets and models aimed at narrowing the performance gap between low and high-resource languages. More specifically, we developed a conditional compute model based on Sparsely Gated Mixture of Experts that is trained on data obtained with novel and effective data mining techniques tailored for low-resource languages. We propose multiple architectural and training improvements to counteract overfitting while training on thousands of tasks. Critically, we evaluated the performance of over 40,000 different translation directions using a human-translated benchmark, Flores-200, and combined human evaluation with a novel toxicity benchmark covering all languages in Flores-200 to assess translation safety. Our model achieves an improvement of 44% BLEU relative to the previous state-of-the-art, laying important groundwork towards realizing a universal translation system.

Recent approaches using large-scale pretrained language models (LMs) have shown promising results, yet they have some critical limitations. In particular, they often follow a standard supervised fine-tuning procedure to train a code generation model only from the pairs of natural-language problem descriptions and ground-truth programs. Such paradigm largely ignores some important but potentially useful signals in the problem specification such as unit tests, which thus often results in poor performance when solving complex unseen coding tasks. To address the limitations, we propose ""CodeRL"", a new framework for program synthesis tasks through pretrained LMs and deep reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, during training, we treat the code-generating LM as an actor network, and introduce a critic network that is trained to predict the functional correctness of generated programs and provide dense feedback signals to the actor. During inference, we introduce a new generation procedure with a critical sampling strategy that allows a model to automatically regenerate programs based on feedback from example unit tests and critic scores. For the model backbones, we extended the encoder-decoder architecture of CodeT5 with enhanced learning objectives, larger model sizes, and better pretraining data.

In contrast to standard encoder-decoder transformers where all decoder layers attend to encoder outputs, CoCa omits cross-attention in the first half of decoder layers to encode unimodal text representations, and cascades the remaining decoder layers which cross-attend to the image encoder for multimodal image-text representations. We apply a contrastive loss between unimodal image and text embeddings, in addition to a captioning loss on the multimodal decoder outputs which predicts text tokens autoregressively. By sharing the same computational graph, the two training objectives are computed efficiently with minimal overhead. CoCa is pretrained end-to-end and from scratch on both web-scale alt-text data and annotated images by treating all labels simply as text, seamlessly unifying natural language supervision for representation learning. Empirically, CoCa achieves state-of-the-art performance with zero-shot transfer or minimal task-specific adaptation on a broad range of downstream tasks, spanning visual recognition (ImageNet, Kinetics-400/600/700, Moments-in-Time), crossmodal retrieval (MSCOCO, Flickr30K, MSR-VTT), multimodal understanding (VQA, SNLI-VE, NLVR2), and image captioning (MSCOCO, NoCaps).

However, there is still a need to bridge the gap between what RNNs are capable of in terms of efficiency and performance and real-world application requirements. The memory and computational requirements arising from propagating the activations of all the neurons at every time step to every connected neuron, together with the sequential dependence of activations, contribute to the inefficiency of training and using RNNs. We propose a solution inspired by biological neuron dynamics that makes the communication between RNN units sparse and discrete. This makes the backward pass with backpropagation through time (BPTT) computationally sparse and efficient as well. We base our model on the gated recurrent unit (GRU), extending it with units that emit discrete events for communication triggered by a threshold so that no information is communicated to other units in the absence of events. We show theoretically that the communication between units, and hence the computation required for both the forward and backward passes, scales with the number of events in the network. Our model achieves efficiency without compromising task performance, demonstrating competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art recurrent network models in real-world tasks, including language modeling. The dynamic activity sparsity mechanism also makes our model well suited for novel energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware.

Despite their potentially transformative impact, these new capabilities are as yet poorly characterized. In order to inform future research, prepare for disruptive new model capabilities, and ameliorate socially harmful effects, it is vital that we understand the present and near-future capabilities and limitations of language models. To address this challenge, we introduce the Beyond the Imitation Game benchmark (BIG-bench). BIG-bench currently consists of 204 tasks, contributed by 450 authors across 132 institutions. Task topics are diverse, drawing problems from linguistics, childhood development, math, common-sense reasoning, biology, physics, social bias, software development, and beyond. BIG-bench focuses on tasks that are believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language models. We evaluate the behavior of OpenAI's GPT models, Google-internal dense transformer architectures, and Switch-style sparse transformers on BIG-bench, across model sizes spanning millions to hundreds of billions of parameters. In addition, a team of human expert raters performed all tasks in order to provide a strong baseline. Findings include: model performance and calibration both improve with scale, but are poor in absolute terms (and when compared with rater performance); performance is remarkably similar across model classes, though with benefits from sparsity; tasks that improve gradually and predictably commonly involve a large knowledge or memorization component, whereas tasks that exhibit ""breakthrough"" behavior at a critical scale often involve multiple steps or components, or brittle metrics; social bias typically increases with scale in settings with ambiguous context, but this can be improved with prompting.",2024-03-07 15:22,Anonymous,,0,United States of America,,,,,,,,,,,,Industry,,,,,,,,Industry,,,

Diffusion-GAN consists of three components, including an adaptive diffusion process, a diffusion timestep-dependent discriminator, and a generator. Both the observed and generated data are diffused by the same adaptive diffusion process. At each diffusion timestep, there is a different noise-to-data ratio and the timestep-dependent discriminator learns to distinguish the diffused real data from the diffused generated data. The generator learns from the discriminator’s feedback by backpropagating through the forward diffusion chain, whose length is adaptively adjusted to balance the noise and data levels. We theoretically show that the discriminator’s timestep-dependent strategy gives consistent and helpful guidance to the generator, enabling it to match the true data distribution.

To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders.

The accumulation of sequencing data has enabled researchers to predict the interactions between RNA sequences and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) using novel machine learning techniques. However, existing models are often difficult to interpret and require additional information to sequences. Bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT) is a language-based deep learning model that is highly interpretable. Therefore, a model based on BERT architecture can potentially overcome such limitations.

Results
Here, we propose BERT-RBP as a model to predict RNA–RBP interactions by adapting the BERT architecture pretrained on a human reference genome. Our model outperformed state-of-the-art prediction models using the eCLIP-seq data of 154 RBPs. The detailed analysis further revealed that BERT-RBP could recognize both the transcript region type and RNA secondary structure only based on sequence information. Overall, the results provide insights into the fine-tuning mechanism of BERT in biological contexts and provide evidence of the applicability of the model to other RNA-related problems.",2024-05-22 13:39,Anonymous,,,Japan,DNABERT,22000000000000000,"""The models were trained on four NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs (128

A popular approach to reduce their compute or memory requirements is to replace dense weight matrices with structured ones (e.g., sparse, low-rank, Fourier transform). These methods have not seen widespread adoption (1) in end-to-end training due to unfavorable efficiency--quality tradeoffs, and (2) in dense-to-sparse fine-tuning due to lack of tractable algorithms to approximate a given dense weight matrix. To address these issues, we propose a class of matrices (Monarch) that is hardware-efficient (they are parameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices for better hardware utilization) and expressive (they can represent many commonly used transforms). Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution. These properties of Monarch matrices unlock new ways to train and fine-tune sparse and dense models. We empirically validate that Monarch can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications: speeding up ViT and GPT-2 training on ImageNet classification and Wikitext-103 language modeling by 2x with comparable model quality, and reducing the error on PDE solving and MRI reconstruction tasks by 40%. In sparse-to-dense training, with a simple technique called ""reverse sparsification,"" Monarch matrices serve as a useful intermediate representation to speed up GPT-2 pretraining on OpenWebText by 2x without quality drop.

We test this hypothesis by training a predicted compute-optimal model, \chinchilla, that uses the same compute budget as \gopher but with 70B parameters and 4× more more data. \chinchilla uniformly and significantly outperforms \Gopher (280B), GPT-3 (175B), Jurassic-1 (178B), and Megatron-Turing NLG (530B) on a large range of downstream evaluation tasks. This also means that \chinchilla uses substantially less compute for fine-tuning and inference, greatly facilitating downstream usage. As a highlight, \chinchilla reaches a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 67.5\% on the MMLU benchmark, greater than a 7\% improvement over \gopher.",2024-05-01 10:22,Robi Rahman,Chinchilla,0,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,,,,,Chinchilla,,,,3000000,"Table 1.

""To narrow the universe of molecules we chose to drive the generative model towards compounds like the nerve agent VX, one of the most toxic chemical warfare agents developed during the 20th century—a few salt-sized grains of VX, (6–10 mg)5, is sufficient to kill a person. Nerve agents such as Novichoks have also been in the headlines recently6.

In less than 6 hours after starting on our in-house server, our model generated forty thousand molecules that scored within our desired threshold. In the process, the AI designed not only VX, but many other known chemical warfare agents that we identified through visual confirmation with structures in public chemistry databases. Many new molecules were also designed that looked equally plausible. These new molecules were predicted to be more toxic based on the predicted LD50 in comparison to publicly known chemical warfare agents (Figure 1). This was unexpected as the datasets we used for training the AI did not include these nerve agents. The virtual molecules even occupied a region of molecular property space that was entirely separate to the many thousands of molecules in the organism-specific LD50 model, which is mainly made up of pesticides, environmental toxins, and drugs (Figure 1). By inverting the use of our machine learning models, we had transformed our innocuous generative model from a helpful tool of medicine to a generator of likely deadly molecules.""",Unreleased,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9544280/,148.00,Dual Use of Artificial Intelligence-powered Drug Discovery,2022-03-07,Collaborations Pharmaceuticals,,"model details here: https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/61551803d1fc335b7cf8fd45

We quantify safety using a metric based on an illustrative set of human values, and we find that filtering candidate responses using a LaMDA classifier fine-tuned with a small amount of crowdworker-annotated data offers a promising approach to improving model safety.

The training and inference costs of these models, however, have grown rapidly and become prohibitively expensive. Here we aim to reduce the costs of Transformers by searching for a more efficient variant. Compared to previous approaches, our search is performed at a lower level, over the primitives that define a Transformer TensorFlow program. We identify an architecture, named Primer, that has a smaller training cost than the original Transformer and other variants for auto-regressive language modeling. Primer's improvements can be mostly attributed to two simple modifications: squaring ReLU activations and adding a depthwise convolution layer after each Q, K, and V projection in self-attention. Experiments show Primer's gains over Transformer increase as compute scale grows and follow a power law with respect to quality at optimal model sizes. We also verify empirically that Primer can be dropped into different codebases to significantly speed up training without additional tuning. For example, at a 500M parameter size, Primer improves the original T5 architecture on C4 auto-regressive language modeling, reducing the training cost by 4X. Furthermore, the reduced training cost means Primer needs much less compute to reach a target one-shot performance. For instance, in a 1.9B parameter configuration similar to GPT-3 XL, Primer uses 1/3 of the training compute to achieve the same one-shot performance as Transformer.

General protein language models have been shown to summarize the semantics of protein sequences into representations that are useful for state-of-the-art predictive methods. However, for antibody specific problems, such as restoring residues lost due to sequencing errors, a model trained solely on antibodies may be more powerful. Antibodies are one of the few protein types where the volume of sequence data needed for such language models is available, e.g. in the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) database.

Results
Here, we introduce AbLang, a language model trained on the antibody sequences in the OAS database. We demonstrate the power of AbLang by using it to restore missing residues in antibody sequence data, a key issue with B-cell receptor repertoire sequencing, e.g. over 40% of OAS sequences are missing the first 15 amino acids. AbLang restores the missing residues of antibody sequences better than using IMGT germlines or the general protein language model ESM-1b. Further, AbLang does not require knowledge of the germline of the antibody and is seven times faster than ESM-1b.",2024-03-07 15:22,Anonymous,,,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,,,,,,,,,,,Academia,,,,,,,,Academia,,,

Image classifiers, on the other hand, reason about much larger vocabularies, as their datasets are larger and easier to collect. We propose Detic, which simply trains the classifiers of a detector on image classification data and thus expands the vocabulary of detectors to tens of thousands of concepts. Unlike prior work, Detic does not need complex assignment schemes to assign image labels to boxes based on model predictions, making it much easier to implement and compatible with a range of detection architectures and backbones. Our results show that Detic yields excellent detectors even for classes without box annotations. It outperforms prior work on both open-vocabulary and long-tail detection benchmarks. Detic provides a gain of 2.4 mAP for all classes and 8.3 mAP for novel classes on the open-vocabulary LVIS benchmark. On the standard LVIS benchmark, Detic obtains 41.7 mAP when evaluated on all classes, or only rare classes, hence closing the gap in performance for object categories with few samples. For the first time, we train a detector with all the twenty-one-thousand classes of the ImageNet dataset and show that it generalizes to new datasets without finetuning.

While Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) sets continue to expand our understanding of the mutational landscape of single proteins, the results continue to challenge analyses. Protein Language Models (pLMs) use the latest deep learning (DL) algorithms to leverage growing databases of protein sequences. These methods learn to predict missing or masked amino acids from the context of entire sequence regions. Here, we used pLM representations (embeddings) to predict sequence conservation and SAV effects without multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). Embeddings alone predicted residue conservation almost as accurately from single sequences as ConSeq using MSAs (two-state Mat- thews Correlation Coefficient—MCC—for ProtT5 embeddings of 0.596 ± 0.006 vs. 0.608 ± 0.006 for ConSeq). Inputting the conservation prediction along with BLOSUM62 substitution scores and pLM mask reconstruction probabilities into a simplistic logistic regression (LR) ensemble for Variant Effect Score Prediction without Alignments (VESPA) predicted SAV effect magnitude without any optimization on DMS data. Comparing predictions for a standard set of 39 DMS experiments to other methods (incl. ESM-1v, DeepSequence, and GEMME) revealed our approach as competitive with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods using MSA input. No method outperformed all others, neither consistently nor statistically significantly, independently of the performance measure applied (Spearman and Pearson correlation). Finally, we investigated binary effect predictions on DMS experiments for four human proteins. Overall, embedding-based methods have become competi- tive with methods relying on MSAs for SAV effect prediction at a fraction of the costs in computing/energy. Our method predicted SAV effects for the entire human proteome (~ 20 k proteins) within 40 min on one Nvidia Quadro RTX 8000.

However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner.

In this work, we train multilingual generative language models on a corpus covering a diverse set of languages, and study their few- and zero-shot learning capabilities in a wide range of tasks. Our largest model with 7.5 billion parameters sets new state of the art in few-shot learning in more than 20 representative languages, outperforming GPT-3 of comparable size in multilingual commonsense reasoning (with +7.4% absolute accuracy improvement in 0-shot settings and +9.4% in 4-shot settings) and natural language inference (+5.4% in each of 0-shot and 4-shot settings). On the FLORES-101 machine translation benchmark, our model outperforms GPT-3 on 171 out of 182 directions with 32 training examples, while surpassing the official supervised baseline in 45 directions. We conduct an in-depth analysis of different multilingual prompting approaches, showing in particular that strong few-shot learning performance across languages can be achieved via cross-lingual transfer through both templates and demonstration examples. Finally, we evaluate our models in social value tasks such as hate speech detection in five languages and find it has limitations similar to comparable sized GPT-3 models.

application of pre-trained LLM for Click-through-rate (CTR) prediction for product
advertisement in e-commerce. This is challenging because the model needs to a)
learn from language as well as tabular data features, b) maintain low-latency (<5 ms)
at inference time, and c) adapt to constantly changing advertisement distribution.
We first show that scaling the pre-trained language model to 1.5 billion parameters
significantly improves performance over conventional CTR baselines. We then
present CTR-BERT, a novel lightweight cache-friendly factorized model for CTR
prediction that consists of twin-structured BERT-like encoders for text with a
mechanism for late fusion for text and tabular features. We train the CTR-BERT
model using cross-architecture knowledge distillation (KD) and empirically study
the interaction between KD and distribution shift in this setting, by a) experimenting
with pre-training, distillation pre-finetuning and fine-tuning strategies b) factorizing
features based on their distribution shift time scales, that allows the model to
readily adapt and be re-trained. Finally, we show that CTR-BERT significantly
outperforms a traditional CTR baseline with a 2.3% relative ROC-AUC lift in
offline experiments and a 2% CTR lift in an online experiment",2024-04-01 10:35,Bartosz Podkanowicz,,,United States of America,,,,8,,,,,,,,Industry,,,,,,,,Industry,,,

Ideally, one would like to reduce their computational cost while retaining their generalization benefits. Sparse model training is a simple and promising approach to achieve this, but there remain challenges as existing methods struggle with accuracy loss, slow training runtime, or difficulty in sparsifying all model components. The core problem is that searching for a sparsity mask over a discrete set of sparse matrices is difficult and expensive. To address this, our main insight is to optimize over a continuous superset of sparse matrices with a fixed structure known as products of butterfly matrices. As butterfly matrices are not hardware efficient, we propose simple variants of butterfly (block and flat) to take advantage of modern hardware. Our method (Pixelated Butterfly) uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers (e.g., attention, MLP). We empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On the ImageNet classification and WikiText-103 language modeling tasks, our sparse models train up to 2.5x faster than the dense MLP-Mixer, Vision Transformer, and GPT-2 medium with no drop in accuracy.",2024-05-22 13:36,Robi Rahman,GPT-2-Small+Pixelfly,1,"United States of America,United States of America,China,United States of America,United States of America",,,,,,,,,,,,"Academia,Industry,Academia,Industry,Academia",,,,,Open source,,Apache for code: https://github.com/HazyResearch/fly,"Academia,Industry,Academia,Industry,Academia",,,

Furthermore, recent years have witnessed an exponential growth of the model scale--from Google's 2016 model with 1 billion parameters to the latest Facebook's model with 12 trillion parameters. Significant quality boost has come with each jump of the model capacity, which makes us believe the era of 100 trillion parameters is around the corner. However, the training of such models is challenging even within industrial scale data centers. This difficulty is inherited from the staggering heterogeneity of the training computation--the model's embedding layer could include more than 99.99% of the total model size, which is extremely memory-intensive; while the rest neural network is increasingly computation-intensive. To support the training of such huge models, an efficient distributed training system is in urgent need. In this paper, we resolve this challenge by careful co-design of both the optimization algorithm and the distributed system architecture. Specifically, in order to ensure both the training efficiency and the training accuracy, we design a novel hybrid training algorithm, where the embedding layer and the dense neural network are handled by different synchronization mechanisms; then we build a system called Persia (short for parallel recommendation training system with hybrid acceleration) to support this hybrid training algorithm.

While existing vision foundation models such as CLIP, ALIGN, and Wu Dao 2.0 focus mainly on mapping images and textual representations to a cross-modal shared representation, we introduce a new computer vision foundation model, Florence, to expand the representations from coarse (scene) to fine (object), from static (images) to dynamic (videos), and from RGB to multiple modalities (caption, depth). By incorporating universal visual-language representations from Web-scale image-text data, our Florence model can be easily adapted for various computer vision tasks, such as classification, retrieval, object detection, VQA, image caption, video retrieval and action recognition. Moreover, Florence demonstrates outstanding performance in many types of transfer learning: fully sampled fine-tuning, linear probing, few-shot transfer and zero-shot transfer for novel images and objects. All of these properties are critical for our vision foundation model to serve general purpose vision tasks.

First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to train large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3x or more) and improve accuracy.

CLIP vision models that have a rich representation are pre-trained using the InfoNCE objective and natural language supervision before they are fine-tuned on particular tasks. Though CLIP excels at zero-shot transfer learning, it suffers from an explaining away problem, that is, it focuses on one or few features, while neglecting other relevant features. This problem is caused by insufficiently extracting the covariance structure in the original multi-modal data. We suggest to use modern Hopfield networks to tackle the problem of explaining away. Their retrieved embeddings have an enriched covariance structure derived from co-occurrences of features in the stored embeddings. However, modern Hopfield networks increase the saturation effect of the InfoNCE objective which hampers learning. We propose to use the InfoLOOB objective to mitigate this saturation effect. We introduce the novel ""Contrastive Leave One Out Boost"" (CLOOB), which uses modern Hopfield networks for covariance enrichment together with the InfoLOOB objective. In experiments we compare CLOOB to CLIP after pre-training on the Conceptual Captions and the YFCC dataset with respect to their zero-shot transfer learning performance on other datasets.

We build a directed heterogeneous graph between an input context and its semantically related neighbors selected from the training corpus, where nodes are tokens in the input context and retrieved neighbor contexts, and edges represent connections between nodes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are constructed upon the graph to aggregate information from similar contexts to decode the token.

We propose to address this problem by integrating a semi-parametric representation of a large text corpus into a Transformer model as a source of factual knowledge. Specifically, our method represents knowledge with `mention memory', a table of dense vector representations of every entity mention in a corpus. The proposed model - TOME - is a Transformer that accesses the information through internal memory layers in which each entity mention in the input passage attends to the mention memory. This approach enables synthesis of and reasoning over many disparate sources of information within a single Transformer model. In experiments using a memory of 150 million Wikipedia mentions, TOME achieves strong performance on several open-domain knowledge-intensive tasks, including the claim verification benchmarks HoVer and FEVER and several entity-based QA benchmarks. We also show that the model learns to attend to informative mentions without any direct supervision. Finally we demonstrate that the model can generalize to new unseen entities by updating the memory without retraining.

Therefore, analyzing the biological structure and property of protein sequences is critical to the exploration of life, as well as disease detection and drug discovery. Traditional protein analysis methods tend to be labor-intensive and time-consuming. The emergence of deep learning models makes modeling data patterns in large quantities of data possible. Interdisciplinary researchers have begun to leverage deep learning methods to model large biological datasets, e.g. using long short-term memory and convolutional neural network for protein sequence classification. After millions of years of evolution, evolutionary information is encoded in protein sequences.

Deciphering the language of non-coding DNA is one of the fundamental problems in genome research. Gene regulatory code is highly complex due to the existence of polysemy and distant semantic relationship, which previous informatics methods often fail to capture especially in data-scarce scenarios.

Results
To address this challenge, we developed a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder representation, named DNABERT, to capture global and transferrable understanding of genomic DNA sequences based on up and downstream nucleotide contexts. We compared DNABERT to the most widely used programs for genome-wide regulatory elements prediction and demonstrate its ease of use, accuracy and efficiency. We show that the single pre-trained transformers model can simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art performance on prediction of promoters, splice sites and transcription factor binding sites, after easy fine-tuning using small task-specific labeled data. Further, DNABERT enables direct visualization of nucleotide-level importance and semantic relationship within input sequences for better interpretability and accurate identification of conserved sequence motifs and functional genetic variant candidates. Finally, we demonstrate that pre-trained DNABERT with human genome can even be readily applied to other organisms with exceptional performance. We anticipate that the pre-trained DNABERT model can be fined tuned to many other sequence analyses tasks.",2024-05-01 10:13,Anonymous,,,United States of America,,,,,,DNABERT,,,,,,Academia,,,,,Open source,Open source,Apache 2.0: https://github.com/jerryji1993/DNABERT,Academia,,,

To reduce the wall-clock training time, a common practice is to increase the batch size and learning rate. However, such practice is often brittle and leads to a so-called stability-efficiency dilemma: increasing the batch sizes and learning rates leads to better training efficiency but can also result in training instability, leading to poor generalization accuracy or failed runs. To better understand this phenomenon, we conduct an in-depth analysis on large-scale pre-training experiments replicating the GPT-2 model. We find that there is a strong correlation between training instability and extreme values of gradient variance, and that samples with long sequence lengths contribute to these extreme gradient variance values, especially at the beginning of the training, indicating that long sequence length can be a main source of training instability. Based on the analysis, we present a Sequence Length Warmup method that aims to solve the training stability-efficiency dilemma. Experiments replicating GPT-2 models show that our approach enables stable training with 8x larger batch size and 4x larger learning rate, whereas the baseline approach struggles with training instability. To achieve the same or better zero-shot evaluation results, our method reduces the required number of training tokens and wall clock time by up to 2.2x and 3.7x, respectively. Experiments replicating GPT-3 model (125M) show that our approach enables stable training with 8x larger batch size and 40x larger learning rate, and retains 99% of the zero-shot accuracy on 11 tasks using 10x less data and 17x less time compared to the original GPT-3 training recipe, while the baseline diverges under the same settings and only retain 95% of accuracy under lower learning rate.",2024-05-09 14:44,Robi Rahman,"""GPT-2 (117M, SLW 110K)""",1,United States of America,,,,,,,,,,,,Industry,,,,,Unreleased,,there's a repo for the technique but I don't see training code for this model: https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed ,Industry,,,

quadratic complexity. We analyze and validate the advantage of FMMformers

- 3.9e11 / 5e4 = 8e6 s → ~93 days
- 100 million steps is equivalent to 30 minutes of wall-clock time in our setup. (pg 29, fig 27)
- 1e8 steps → 0.5h
- 3.9e11 steps → 1950h → 7.0e6 s → ~82 days
- Both of these seem like overestimates, because:
“Finally, on the largest timescale (days), generational training iteratively improves population performance by bootstrapping off previous generations, whilst also iteratively updating the validation normalised percentile metric itself.” (pg 16)
- Suggests that the above is an overestimate of the number of days needed, else they would have said (months) or (weeks)?
- Final choice (guesstimate): 85 days = 7.3e6 s

We define a universe of tasks within an environment domain and demonstrate the ability to train agents that are generally capable across this vast space and beyond. The environment is natively multi-agent, spanning the continuum of competitive, cooperative, and independent games, which are situated within procedurally generated physical 3D worlds. The resulting space is exceptionally diverse in terms of the challenges posed to agents, and as such, even measuring the learning progress of an agent is an open research problem. We propose an iterative notion of improvement between successive generations of agents, rather than seeking to maximise a singular objective, allowing us to quantify progress despite tasks being incomparable in terms of achievable rewards. We show that through constructing an open-ended learning process, which dynamically changes the training task distributions and training objectives such that the agent never stops learning, we achieve consistent learning of new behaviours. The resulting agent is able to score reward in every one of our humanly solvable evaluation levels, with behaviour generalising to many held-out points in the universe of tasks. Examples of this zero-shot generalisation include good performance on Hide and Seek, Capture the Flag, and Tag. Through analysis and hand-authored probe tasks we characterise the behaviour of our agent, and find interesting emergent heuristic behaviours such as trial-and-error experimentation, simple tool use, option switching, and cooperation.

A key ingredient of our approach is applying the prediction loss over the masked regions only, which forces the model to learn a combined acoustic and language model over the continuous inputs.

(2) We explore the best practice of prompt tuning with large-scale PLMs. Compared with conventional fine-tuning, prompt tuning significantly reduces the number of task-specific parameters. (3) We implement a new inference toolkit, namely InfMoE, for using large-scale PLMs with limited computational resources. Based on our cost-effective pipeline, we pre-train two models: an encoder-decoder bilingual model with 11 billion parameters (CPM-2) and its corresponding MoE version with 198 billion parameters. In our experiments, we compare CPM-2 with mT5 on downstream tasks. Experimental results show that CPM-2 has excellent general language intelligence.

While representation learning in NLP has transitioned to training on raw text without human annotations, visual and vision-language representations still rely heavily on curated training datasets that are expensive or require expert knowledge. For vision applications, representations are mostly learned using datasets with explicit class labels such as ImageNet or OpenImages. For vision-language, popular datasets like Conceptual Captions, MSCOCO, or CLIP all involve a non-trivial data collection (and cleaning) process. This costly curation process limits the size of datasets and hence hinders the scaling of trained models. In this paper, we leverage a noisy dataset of over one billion image alt-text pairs, obtained without expensive filtering or post-processing steps in the Conceptual Captions dataset. A simple dual-encoder architecture learns to align visual and language representations of the image and text pairs using a contrastive loss. We show that the scale of our corpus can make up for its noise and leads to state-of-the-art representations even with such a simple learning scheme. Our visual representation achieves strong performance when transferred to classification tasks such as ImageNet and VTAB. The aligned visual and language representations enables zero-shot image classification and also set new state-of-the-art results on Flickr30K and MSCOCO image-text retrieval benchmarks, even when compared with more sophisticated cross-attention models.

In this paper we propose a new model architecture DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention) that improves the BERT and RoBERTa models using two novel techniques. The first is the disentangled attention mechanism, where each word is represented using two vectors that encode its content and position, respectively, and the attention weights among words are computed using disentangled matrices on their contents and relative positions, respectively. Second, an enhanced mask decoder is used to incorporate absolute positions in the decoding layer to predict the masked tokens in model pre-training. In addition, a new virtual adversarial training method is used for fine-tuning to improve models' generalization. We show that these techniques significantly improve the efficiency of model pre-training and the performance of both natural language understanding (NLU) and natural langauge generation (NLG) downstream tasks. Compared to RoBERTa-Large, a DeBERTa model trained on half of the training data performs consistently better on a wide range of NLP tasks, achieving improvements on MNLI by +0.9% (90.2% vs. 91.1%), on SQuAD v2.0 by +2.3% (88.4% vs. 90.7%) and RACE by +3.6% (83.2% vs. 86.8%).

This paper shows that recurrent neural networks can be reformulated as fixed-points of non-linear equation systems. These fixed-points can be computed using an iterative algorithm exactly and in as many iterations as the length of any given sequence. Each iteration of this algorithm adds one additional Markovian-like order of dependencies such that upon termination all dependencies modelled by the recurrent neural networks have been incorporated. Although exact fixed-points inherit the same parallelization and inconsistency issues, this paper shows that approximate fixed-points can be computed in parallel and used consistently in training and inference including tasks such as lattice rescoring.

Today, we’re sharing how we're addressing one many of us can identify with: having to type out many queries and perform many searches to get the answer you need.

Take this scenario: You’ve hiked Mt. Adams. Now you want to hike Mt. Fuji next fall, and you want to know what to do differently to prepare. Today, Google could help you with this, but it would take many thoughtfully considered searches — you’d have to search for the elevation of each mountain, the average temperature in the fall, difficulty of the hiking trails, the right gear to use, and more. After a number of searches, you’d eventually be able to get the answer you need.

But if you were talking to a hiking expert; you could ask one question — “what should I do differently to prepare?” You’d get a thoughtful answer that takes into account the nuances of your task at hand and guides you through the many things to consider.  

This example is not unique — many of us tackle all sorts of tasks that require multiple steps with Google every day. In fact, we find that people issue eight queries on average for complex tasks like this one. 

Today's search engines aren't quite sophisticated enough to answer the way an expert would.

Finally, we find that classifier guidance combines well with upsampling diffusion models, further improving FID to 3.94 on ImageNet 256×256 and 3.85 on ImageNet 512×512.",2024-05-21 02:10,Anonymous,,,United States of America,,,,,,ADM,,,,,,Industry,,,,,Open access (non-commercial),,"These models are intended to be used for research purposes only.

leveraging the properties of standard nonlinear
activation functions, we show that the problem
is equivalent to an approximate subdifferential

approximation controls the sparsity. We show
that the proposed approach is valid for a broad

the sparsity can be ensured from partial training

However, training these models efficiently is challenging for two reasons: a) GPU memory capacity is limited, making it impossible to fit large models on even a multi-GPU server, and b) the number of compute operations required to train these models can result in unrealistically long training times. Consequently, new methods of model parallelism such as tensor and pipeline parallelism have been proposed. Unfortunately, naive usage of these methods leads to fundamental scaling issues at thousands of GPUs, e.g., due to expensive cross-node communication or devices spending significant time waiting on other devices to make progress.
In this paper, we show how different types of parallelism methods (tensor, pipeline, and data parallelism) can be composed to scale to thousands of GPUs and models with trillions of parameters. We survey techniques for pipeline parallelism and propose a novel interleaved pipeline parallelism schedule that can improve throughput by 10+% with memory footprint comparable to existing approaches.

Although self-attention mechanism provides a means to exploit long context, the sequential information, i.e. the arrangement of tokens, is not explicitly captured. We propose to cascade the recurrent neural networks to the Transformers, which referred to as the TransfoRNN model, to capture the sequential information. We found that the TransfoRNN models which consists of only shallow Transformers stack is suffice to give comparable, if not better, performance than a deeper Transformer model. Evaluated on the Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 corpora, the proposed TransfoRNN model has shown lower model perplexities with fewer number of model parameters. On the Penn Treebank corpus, the model perplexities were reduced up to 5.5% with the model size reduced up to 10.5%. On the WikiText-2 corpus, the model perplexity was reduced up to 2.2% with a 27.7% smaller model. Also, the TransfoRNN model was applied on the LibriSpeech speech recognition task and has shown comparable results with the Transformer models.",2024-05-09 14:30,Robi Rahman,TransfoRNN(d=1024)(2-layer) (PTB),1,China,,,,,,,,,,,,Industry,,,,,Unreleased,,,Industry,,,

We propose two new ways to evaluate commonsense models, emphasizing their generality on new tasks and building on diverse, recently introduced benchmarks. First, we propose a new multitask benchmark, RAINBOW, to promote research on commonsense models that generalize well over multiple tasks and datasets. Second, we propose a novel evaluation, the cost equivalent curve, that sheds new insight on how the choice of source datasets, pretrained language models, and transfer learning methods impacts performance and data efficiency.
We perform extensive experiments -- over 200 experiments encompassing 4800 models -- and report multiple valuable and sometimes surprising findings, e.g., that transfer almost always leads to better or equivalent performance if following a particular recipe, that QA-based commonsense datasets transfer well with each other, while commonsense knowledge graphs do not, and that perhaps counter-intuitively, larger models benefit more from transfer than smaller ones.
Last but not least, we introduce a new universal commonsense reasoning model, UNICORN, that establishes new state-of-the-art performance across 8 popular commonsense benchmarks, aNLI (87.3%), CosmosQA (91.8%), HellaSWAG (93.9%), PIQA (90.1%), SocialIQa (83.2%), WinoGrande (86.6%), CycIC (94.0%) and CommonsenseQA (79.3%).",2024-05-08 05:47,Natalia Martemianova,,,United States of America,T5-11B,,,,,,,,,,,Research collective,,,,,Open source,,"https://github.com/allenai/rainbow#downloading-the-weights

Our work revisits the canonical ResNet (He et al., 2015) and studies these three aspects in an effort to disentangle them. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that training and scaling strategies may matter more than architectural changes, and further, that the resulting ResNets match recent state-of-the-art models. We show that the best performing scaling strategy depends on the training regime and offer two new scaling strategies: (1) scale model depth in regimes where overfitting can occur (width scaling is preferable otherwise); (2) increase image resolution more slowly than previously recommended (Tan & Le, 2019). Using improved training and scaling strategies, we design a family of ResNet architectures, ResNet-RS, which are 1.7x - 2.7x faster than EfficientNets on TPUs, while achieving similar accuracies on ImageNet. In a large-scale semi-supervised learning setup, ResNet-RS achieves 86.2% top-1 ImageNet accuracy, while being 4.7x faster than EfficientNet NoisyStudent. The training techniques improve transfer performance on a suite of downstream tasks (rivaling state-of-the-art self-supervised algorithms) and extend to video classification on Kinetics-400.

Still it is a mystery how MoE layers bring quality gains by leveraging the parameters with sparse activation. In this work, we investigate several key factors in sparse expert models. We observe that load imbalance may not be a significant problem affecting model quality, contrary to the perspectives of recent studies, while the number of sparsely activated experts k and expert capacity C in top-k routing can significantly make a difference in this context. Furthermore, we take a step forward to propose a simple method called expert prototyping that splits experts into different prototypes and applies k top-1 routing. This strategy improves the model quality but maintains constant computational costs, and our further exploration on extremely large-scale models reflects that it is more effective in training larger models. We push the model scale to over 1 trillion parameters and implement it on solely 480 NVIDIA V100-32GB GPUs, in comparison with the recent SOTAs on 2048 TPU cores.

Here, we develop ProteinGAN, a self-attention-based variant of the generative adversarial network that is able to ‘learn’ natural protein sequence diversity and enables the generation of functional protein sequences. ProteinGAN learns the evolutionary relationships of protein sequences directly from the complex multidimensional amino-acid sequence space and creates new, highly diverse sequence variants with natural-like physical properties. Using malate dehydrogenase (MDH) as a template enzyme, we show that 24% (13 out of 55 tested) of the ProteinGAN-generated and experimentally tested sequences are soluble and display MDH catalytic activity in the tested conditions in vitro, including a highly mutated variant of 106 amino-acid substitutions. ProteinGAN therefore demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence to rapidly generate highly diverse functional proteins within the allowed biological constraints of the sequence space.",2024-02-02 17:45,Anonymous,,,"Lithuania,Sweden",,,,1,,,,,,,,"Academia,Academia",,,,210,,,,"Academia,Academia",,,

Such Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs) learn to manipulate the contents of a finite memory and dynamically interact with it. We infer a memory capacity limitation of recent linearised softmax attention variants, and replace the purely additive outer products by a delta rule-like programming instruction, such that the FWP can more easily learn to correct the current mapping from keys to values.

More importantly, we introduce a teacher-student strategy specific to transformers. It relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student learns from the teacher through attention. We show the interest of this token-based distillation, especially when using a convnet as a teacher.

Conventional regularization methods, such as Dropout or weight decay, do not leverage the structures of the network's inputs and hidden states. As a result, these conventional methods are less effective than methods that leverage the structures, such as SpatialDropout and DropBlock, which randomly drop the values at certain contiguous areas in the hidden states and setting them to zero. Although the locations of dropout areas random, the patterns of SpatialDropout and DropBlock are manually designed and fixed. Here we propose to learn the dropout patterns. In our method, a controller learns to generate a dropout pattern at every channel and layer of a target network, such as a ConvNet or a Transformer. The target network is then trained with the dropout pattern, and its resulting validation performance is used as a signal for the controller to learn from. We show that this method works well for both image recognition on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, as well as language modeling on Penn Treebank and WikiText-2.

Through an enormous experimental effort, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years. Despite recent progress, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14), demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods.

The proposed model treats words and entities in a given text as independent tokens, and outputs contextualized representations of them. Our model is trained using a new pretraining task based on the masked language model of BERT. The task involves predicting randomly masked words and entities in a large entity-annotated corpus retrieved from Wikipedia.

Previous work in multilingual pretraining has demonstrated that machine translation systems can be created by finetuning on bitext. In this work, we show that multilingual translation models can be created through multilingual finetuning. Instead of finetuning on one direction, a pretrained model is finetuned on many directions at the same time. Compared to multilingual models trained from scratch, starting from pretrained models incorporates the benefits of large quantities of unlabeled monolingual data, which is particularly important for low resource languages where bitext is not available. We demonstrate that pretrained models can be extended to incorporate additional languages without loss of performance. We double the number of languages in mBART to support multilingual machine translation models of 50 languages. Finally, we create the ML50 benchmark, covering low, mid, and high resource languages, to facilitate reproducible research by standardizing training and evaluation data. On ML50, we demonstrate that multilingual finetuning improves on average 1 BLEU over the strongest baselines (being either multilingual from scratch or bilingual finetuning) while improving 9.3 BLEU on average over bilingual baselines from scratch.

We demonstrate the capability to train very large DLRMs with up to 12 Trillion parameters and show that we can attain 40 × speedup in terms of time to solution over previous systems. We achieve this by (i) designing the ZionEX platform with dedicated scale-out network, provisioned with high bandwidth, optimal topology and efficient transport (ii) implementing an optimized PyTorch-based training stack supporting both model and data parallelism (iii) developing sharding algorithms capable of hierarchical partitioning of the embedding tables along row, column dimensions and load balancing them across multiple workers; (iv) adding high-performance core operators while retaining flexibility to support optimizers with fully deterministic updates (v) leveraging reduced precision communications, multi-level memory hierarchy (HBM+DDR+SSD) and pipelining.

Second order algorithms are among the most powerful optimization algorithms with superior convergence properties as compared to first order methods such as SGD and Adam. The main disadvantage of traditional second order methods is their heavier per iteration computation and poor accuracy as compared to first order methods. To address these, we incorporate several novel approaches in ADAHESSIAN, including: (i) a fast Hutchinson based method to approximate the curvature matrix with low computational overhead; (ii) a root-mean-square exponential moving average to smooth out variations of the Hessian diagonal across different iterations; and (iii) a block diagonal averaging to reduce the variance of Hessian diagonal elements. We show that ADAHESSIAN achieves new state-of-the-art results by a large margin as compared to other adaptive optimization methods, including variants of Adam. In particular, we perform extensive tests on CV, NLP, and recommendation system tasks and find that ADAHESSIAN: (i) achieves 1.80%/1.45% higher accuracy on ResNets20/32 on Cifar10, and 5.55% higher accuracy on ImageNet as compared to Adam; (ii) outperforms AdamW for transformers by 0.13/0.33 BLEU score on IWSLT14/WMT14 and 2.7/1.0 PPL on PTB/Wikitext-103; (iii) outperforms AdamW for SqueezeBert by 0.41 points on GLUE; and (iv) achieves 0.032% better score than Adagrad for DLRM on the Criteo Ad Kaggle dataset.

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans.

direct set prediction problem. Our approach streamlines the detection
pipeline, effectively removing the need for many hand-designed components like a non-maximum suppression procedure or anchor generation
that explicitly encode our prior knowledge about the task. The main
ingredients of the new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or
DETR, are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Given
a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output
the final set of predictions in parallel. The new model is conceptually
simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other
modern detectors. DETR demonstrates accuracy and run-time performance on par with the well-established and highly-optimized Faster RCNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection dataset. Moreover, DETR can be easily generalized to produce panoptic segmentation
in a unified manner. We show that it significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Training code and pretrained models are available at

Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures.

To verify this, we propose a segment-aware Transformer (Segatron), by replacing the original token position encoding with a combined position encoding of paragraph, sentence, and token. We first introduce the segment-aware mechanism to Transformer-XL, which is a popular Transformer-based language model with memory extension and relative position encoding. We find that our method can further improve the Transformer-XL base model and large model, achieving 17.1 perplexity on the WikiText-103 dataset.

Conventional approaches either manually design or use neural architecture search (NAS) to find a specialized neural network and train it from scratch for each case, which is computationally prohibitive (causing CO2 emission as much as 5 cars' lifetime) thus unscalable. In this work, we propose to train a once-for-all (OFA) network that supports diverse architectural settings by decoupling training and search, to reduce the cost. We can quickly get a specialized sub-network by selecting from the OFA network without additional training. To efficiently train OFA networks, we also propose a novel progressive shrinking algorithm, a generalized pruning method that reduces the model size across many more dimensions than pruning (depth, width, kernel size, and resolution). It can obtain a surprisingly large number of sub-networks (>1019) that can fit different hardware platforms and latency constraints while maintaining the same level of accuracy as training independently. On diverse edge devices, OFA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) NAS methods (up to 4.0% ImageNet top1 accuracy improvement over MobileNetV3, or same accuracy but 1.5x faster than MobileNetV3, 2.6x faster than EfficientNet w.r.t measured latency) while reducing many orders of magnitude GPU hours and CO2 emission.

While they produce good results when transferred to downstream NLP tasks, they generally require large amounts of compute to be effective. As an alternative, we propose a more sample-efficient pre-training task called replaced token detection. Instead of masking the input, our approach corrupts it by replacing some tokens with plausible alternatives sampled from a small generator network. Then, instead of training a model that predicts the original identities of the corrupted tokens, we train a discriminative model that predicts whether each token in the corrupted input was replaced by a generator sample or not. Thorough experiments demonstrate this new pre-training task is more efficient than MLM because the task is defined over all input tokens rather than just the small subset that was masked out. As a result, the contextual representations learned by our approach substantially outperform the ones learned by BERT given the same model size, data, and compute. The gains are particularly strong for small models; for example, we train a model on one GPU for 4 days that outperforms GPT (trained using 30x more compute) on the GLUE natural language understanding benchmark.

This is different than batch normalization (BN), which is widely-adopted in Computer Vision. The preferred use of LN in NLP is principally due to the empirical observation that a (naive/vanilla) use of BN leads to significant performance degradation for NLP tasks; however, a thorough understanding of the underlying reasons for this is not always evident. In this paper, we perform a systematic study of NLP transformer models to understand why BN has a poor performance, as compared to LN. We find that the statistics of NLP data across the batch dimension exhibit large fluctuations throughout training. This results in instability, if BN is naively implemented. To address this, we propose Power Normalization (PN), a novel normalization scheme that resolves this issue by (i) relaxing zero-mean normalization in BN, (ii) incorporating a running quadratic mean instead of per batch statistics to stabilize fluctuations, and (iii) using an approximate backpropagation for incorporating the running statistics in the forward pass. We show theoretically, under mild assumptions, that PN leads to a smaller Lipschitz constant for the loss, compared with BN. Furthermore, we prove that the approximate backpropagation scheme leads to bounded gradients. We extensively test PN for transformers on a range of NLP tasks, and we show that it significantly outperforms both LN and BN. In particular, PN outperforms LN by 0.4/0.6 BLEU on IWSLT14/WMT14 and 5.6/3.0 PPL on PTB/WikiText-103.

Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic compute and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: it combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d.

This problem is of fundamental importance as the structure of a protein largely determines its function; however, protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures. Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of mean force that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP13)—a blind assessment of the state of the field—AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template modelling (TM) scores of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains. AlphaFold represents a considerable advance in protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction of proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for homologous proteins have been experimentally determined.",2024-04-22 16:50,Robi Rahman,,,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,,,,,AlphaFold,,,,,,Industry,,,,,Unreleased,,,Industry,,,

Predicting protein function and structure from sequence is one important challenge for computational biology. For 26 years, most state-of-the-art approaches combined machine learning and evolutionary information. However, for some applications retrieving related proteins is becoming too time-consuming. Additionally, evolutionary information is less powerful for small families, e.g. for proteins from the Dark Proteome. Both these problems are addressed by the new methodology introduced here.
Results
We introduced a novel way to represent protein sequences as continuous vectors (embeddings) by using the language model ELMo taken from natural language processing. By modeling protein sequences, ELMo effectively captured the biophysical properties of the language of life from unlabeled big data (UniRef50). We refer to these new embeddings as SeqVec (Sequence-to-Vector) and demonstrate their effectiveness by training simple neural networks for two different tasks. At the per-residue level, secondary structure (Q3 = 79% ± 1, Q8 = 68% ± 1) and regions with intrinsic disorder (MCC = 0.59 ± 0.03) were predicted significantly better than through one-hot encoding or through Word2vec-like approaches. At the per-protein level, subcellular localization was predicted in ten classes (Q10 = 68% ± 1) and membrane-bound were distinguished from water-soluble proteins (Q2 = 87% ± 1). Although SeqVec embeddings generated the best predictions from single sequences, no solution improved over the best existing method using evolutionary information. Nevertheless, our approach improved over some popular methods using evolutionary information and for some proteins even did beat the best. Thus, they prove to condense the underlying principles of protein sequences. Overall, the important novelty is speed: where the lightning-fast HHblits needed on average about two minutes to generate the evolutionary information for a target protein, SeqVec created embeddings on average in 0.03 s. As this speed-up is independent of the size of growing sequence databases, SeqVec provides a highly scalable approach for the analysis of big data in proteomics, i.e. microbiome or metaproteome analysis.
Conclusion
Transfer-learning succeeded to extract information from unlabeled sequence databases relevant for various protein prediction tasks. SeqVec modeled the language of life, namely the principles underlying protein sequences better than any features suggested by textbooks and prediction methods. The exception is evolutionary information, however, that information is not available on the level of a single sequence.",2024-03-29 17:53,Anonymous,,,Germany,,,,5,,,,,,,,Academia,,,,2540,Unreleased,Open source,"MIT license. doesn't look like it has training code

Tree-based planning methods have enjoyed huge success in challenging domains, such as chess and Go, where a perfect simulator is available. However, in real-world problems the dynamics governing the environment are often complex and unknown. In this work we present the MuZero algorithm which, by combining a tree-based search with a learned model, achieves superhuman performance in a range of challenging and visually complex domains, without any knowledge of their underlying dynamics. MuZero learns a model that, when applied iteratively, predicts the quantities most directly relevant to planning: the reward, the action-selection policy, and the value function. When evaluated on 57 different Atari games - the canonical video game environment for testing AI techniques, in which model-based planning approaches have historically struggled - our new algorithm achieved a new state of the art. When evaluated on Go, chess and shogi, without any knowledge of the game rules, MuZero matched the superhuman performance of the AlphaZero algorithm that was supplied with the game rules.",2024-04-22 14:28,Robi Rahman,,,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,,,,,MuZero,,,,,,Industry,,,,,Unreleased,,,Industry,,,

Specifically, we prove that a multi-head self-attention layer with sufficient number of heads is at least as expressive as any convolutional layer.

In this work, we present our techniques for training very large transformer models and implement a simple, efficient intra-layer model parallel approach that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters. Our approach does not require a new compiler or library changes, is orthogonal and complimentary to pipeline model parallelism, and can be fully implemented with the insertion of a few communication operations in native PyTorch. We illustrate this approach by converging transformer based models up to 8.3 billion parameters using 512 GPUs. We sustain 15.1 PetaFLOPs across the entire application with 76% scaling efficiency when compared to a strong single GPU baseline that sustains 39 TeraFLOPs, which is 30% of peak FLOPs.

We sustain 15.1 PetaFLOPs across the entire application with 76% scaling efficiency when compared to a strong single GPU baseline that sustains 39 TeraFLOPs, which is 30% of peak FLOPs. To demonstrate that large language models can further advance the state of the art (SOTA), we train an 8.3 billion parameter transformer language model similar to GPT-2 and a 3.9 billion parameter model similar to BERT.

Most scientific experiments have controls, confounds which are removed from the data, to ensure that subjects cannot perform a task by exploiting trivial correlations in the data. Historically, large machine learning and computer vision datasets have lacked such controls. This has resulted in models that must be fine-tuned for new datasets and perform better on datasets than in real-world applications. When tested on ObjectNet, object detectors show a 40-45% drop in performance, with respect to their performance on other benchmarks, due to the controls for biases. Controls make ObjectNet robust to fine-tuning showing only small performance increases. We develop a highly automated platform that enables gathering datasets with controls by crowdsourcing image capturing and annotation. ObjectNet is the same size as the ImageNet test set (50,000 images), and by design does not come paired with a training set in order to encourage generalization. The dataset is both easier than ImageNet – objects are largely centered and unoccluded – and harder, due to the controls. Although we focus on object recognition here, data with controls can be gathered at scale using automated tools throughout machine learning to generate datasets that exercise models in new ways thus providing valuable feedback to researchers.

Most state-of-the-art approaches for protein classification tasks are tailored to single classi- fication tasks and rely on handcrafted features such as position-specific-scoring matrices from expensive database searches. We argue that this level of performance can be reached or even be surpassed by learning a task-agnostic representation once, using self-supervised language modeling, and transferring it to specific tasks by a simple finetuning step.
Results: We put forward a universal deep sequence model that is pretrained on unlabeled protein se- quences from Swiss-Prot and finetuned on protein classification tasks. We apply it to three prototypical tasks, namely enzyme class prediction, gene ontology prediction and remote homology and fold detection. The proposed method performs on par with state-of-the-art algorithms that were tailored to these specific tasks or, for two out of three tasks, even outperforms them. These results stress the possibility of inferring protein properties from the sequence alone and, on more general grounds, the prospects of modern natural language processing methods in omics.",2024-04-01 17:50,Anonymous,,,Germany,,,,,,UDSMProt,,,,,,Research collective,,,,,Open source,,BSD license,Research collective,,,

Such a method is equivalent to running an infinite depth (weight-tied) feedforward network, but has the notable advantage that we can analytically backpropagate through the equilibrium point using implicit differentiation. Using this approach, training and prediction in these networks require only constant memory, regardless of the effective ""depth"" of the network. We demonstrate how DEQs can be applied to two state-of-the-art deep sequence models: self-attention transformers and trellis networks. On large-scale language modeling tasks, such as the WikiText-103 benchmark, we show that DEQs 1) often improve performance over these state-of-the-art models (for similar parameter counts); 2) have similar computational requirements to existing models; and 3) vastly reduce memory consumption (often the bottleneck for training large sequence models), demonstrating an up-to 88% memory reduction in our experiments.

For a query sequence, the pipeline starts with the collection of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) from multiple genome and metagenome sequence databases using two complementary Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based searching tools. Three profile matrices, built on covariance, precision, and pseudolikelihood maximization respectively, are then created from the MSAs, which are used as the input features of a deep residual convolutional neural network architecture for contact-map training and prediction. Two ensembling strategies have been proposed to integrate the matrix features through end-to-end training and stacking, resulting in two complementary programs called TripletRes and ResTriplet, respectively. For the 31 free-modeling domains that do not have homologous templates in the PDB, TripletRes and ResTriplet generated comparable results with an average accuracy of 0.640 and 0.646, respectively, for the top L/5 long-range predictions, where 71% and 74% of the cases have an accuracy above 0.5. Detailed data analyses showed that the strength of the pipeline is due to the sensitive MSA construction and the advanced strategies for coevolutionary feature ensembling. Domain splitting was also found to help enhance the contact prediction performance. Nevertheless, contact models for tail regions, which often involve a high number of alignment gaps, and for targets with few homologous sequences are still suboptimal.

In the domain of robotic locomotion, deep RL could enable learning locomotion skills with minimal engineering and without an explicit model of the robot dynamics. Unfortunately, applying deep RL to real-world robotic tasks is exceptionally difficult, primarily due to poor sample complexity and sensitivity to hyperparameters. While hyperparameters can be easily tuned in simulated domains, tuning may be prohibitively expensive on physical systems, such as legged robots, that can be damaged through extensive trial-and-error learning. In this paper, we propose a sample-efficient deep RL algorithm based on maximum entropy RL that requires minimal per-task tuning and only a modest number of trials to learn neural network policies. We apply this method to learning walking gaits on a real-world Minitaur robot. Our method can acquire a stable gait from scratch directly in the real world in about two hours, without relying on any model or simulation, and the resulting policy is robust to moderate variations in the environment. We further show that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated benchmarks with a single set of hyperparameters.

Semi-supervised learning has emerged as an important paradigm in protein modeling due to the high cost of acquiring supervised protein labels, but the current literature is fragmented when it comes to datasets and standardized evaluation techniques. To facilitate progress in this field, we introduce the Tasks Assessing Protein Embeddings (TAPE), a set of five biologically relevant semi-supervised learning tasks spread across different domains of protein biology. We curate tasks into specific training, validation, and test splits to ensure that each task tests biologically relevant generalization that transfers to real-life scenarios. We benchmark a range of approaches to semi-supervised protein representation learning, which span recent work as well as canonical sequence learning techniques. We find that self-supervised pretraining is helpful for almost all models on all tasks, more than doubling performance in some cases. Despite this increase, in several cases features learned by self-supervised pretraining still lag behind features extracted by state-of-the-art non-neural techniques. This gap in performance suggests a huge opportunity for innovative architecture design and improved modeling
paradigms that better capture the signal in biological sequences. TAPE will help the machine learning community focus effort on scientifically relevant problems.

However, existing MCTS based NAS approaches often utilize manually designed action space, which is not directly related to the performance metric to be optimized (e.g., accuracy), leading to sample-inefficient explorations of architectures. To improve the sample efficiency, this paper proposes Latent Action Neural Architecture Search (LaNAS), which learns actions to recursively partition the search space into good or bad regions that contain networks with similar performance metrics. During the search phase, as different action sequences lead to regions with different performance, the search efficiency can be significantly improved by biasing towards the good regions. On three NAS tasks, empirical results demonstrate that LaNAS is at least an order more sample efficient than baseline methods including evolutionary algorithms, Bayesian optimizations, and random search. When applied in practice, both one-shot and regular LaNAS consistently outperform existing results. Particularly, LaNAS achieves 99.0% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 80.8% top1 accuracy at 600 MFLOPS on ImageNet in only 800 samples, significantly outperforming AmoebaNet with 33x fewer samples.

The idea is to introduce adversarial noise to the output embedding layer while training the models. We show that the optimal adversarial noise yields a simple closed-form solution, thus allowing us to develop a simple and time efficient algorithm. Theoretically, we show that our adversarial mechanism effectively encourages the diversity of the embedding vectors, helping to increase the robustness of models. Empirically, we show that our method improves on the single model state-of-the-art results for language modeling on Penn Treebank (PTB) and Wikitext-2, achieving test perplexity scores of 46.01 and 38.07, respectively. When applied to machine translation, our method improves over various transformer-based translation baselines in BLEU scores on the WMT14 English-German and IWSLT14 German-English tasks.",2024-05-22 17:43,Robi Rahman,4 layer QRNN + dynamic evaluation,1,United States of America,,,,,,,,,,,,Academia,,,,,Unreleased,,"there's a repo, but the WT-103 experiments aren't there:

However, the prohibitive computational demand of conventional NAS algorithms (e.g. 104 GPU hours) makes it difficult to \emph{directly} search the architectures on large-scale tasks (e.g. ImageNet). Differentiable NAS can reduce the cost of GPU hours via a continuous representation of network architecture but suffers from the high GPU memory consumption issue (grow linearly w.r.t. candidate set size). As a result, they need to utilize~\emph{proxy} tasks, such as training on a smaller dataset, or learning with only a few blocks, or training just for a few epochs. These architectures optimized on proxy tasks are not guaranteed to be optimal on the target task. In this paper, we present \emph{ProxylessNAS} that can \emph{directly} learn the architectures for large-scale target tasks and target hardware platforms. We address the high memory consumption issue of differentiable NAS and reduce the computational cost (GPU hours and GPU memory) to the same level of regular training while still allowing a large candidate set.

conditioned on a document plus questions, the answers generated by the language model reach 55

We make particular attention to the high-dimensional output problem caused by the very large vocabulary size. We focus on effective compression methods in the context of their exploitation on devices: pruning, quantization, and matrix decomposition approaches (low-rank factorization and tensor train decomposition, in particular). For each model we investigate the trade-off between its size, suitability for fast inference and perplexity.

However, the existing methods usually adopt relatively-low order tensors, which have limited expressive power in modeling language. Developing a higher-order tensor representation is challenging, in terms of deriving an effective solution and showing its generality. In this paper, we propose a language model named Tensor Space Language Model (TSLM), by utilizing tensor networks and tensor decomposition. In TSLM, we build a high-dimensional semantic space constructed by the tensor product of word vectors. Theoretically, we prove that such tensor representation is a generalization of the n-gram language model.

Since synchronizing a large number of gradients of the local model can be a bottleneck for large-scale distributed training, compressing communication data has gained widespread attention recently. Among several recent proposed compression algorithms, Residual Gradient Compression (RGC) is one of the most successful approaches---it can significantly compress the transmitting message size (0.1\% of the gradient size) of each node and still achieve correct accuracy and the same convergence speed. However, the literature on compressing deep networks focuses almost exclusively on achieving good theoretical compression rate, while the efficiency of RGC in real distributed implementation has been less investigated. In this paper, we develop an RGC-based system that is able to reduce the end-to-end training time on real-world multi-GPU systems. Our proposed design called RedSync, which introduces a set of optimizations to reduce communication bandwidth requirement while introducing limited overhead. We evaluate the performance of RedSync on two different multiple GPU platforms, including 128 GPUs of a supercomputer and an 8-GPU server. Our test cases include image classification tasks on Cifar10 and ImageNet, and language modeling tasks on Penn Treebank and Wiki2 datasets. For DNNs featured with high communication to computation ratio, which have long been considered with poor scalability, RedSync brings significant performance improvements.",2024-05-24 13:21,Robi Rahman,RGC+ASQ (PTB),1,"China,United States of America",,,,,,,,,,,,"Academia,Academia",,,,,Unreleased,,,"Academia,Academia",,,

4*(512+2*32)*((512+(32*2) + 3*32 + 5*2 + 3)+(512+2*32)+1) + 2*(256+1)*256

LSTMs usually have 4*(n*m+n*n+n) parameters, where n=input size and m=output size.

This DNS + LSTM takes as input the concatenation of the previous layer of size n and R read vectors of size W=32; and outputs m units plus an interface vector of size (W*R) + 3*W + 5*R + 3, for a total of about 4*(n+R*W)*((m+(W*R) + 3*W + 5*R + 3)+(n+R*32)+1) parameters

I assume R=2 since that seems implied by the previous paper (?)

The first VU has as input the visual embedding (size 256), the previous action (size 540) and the previous reward (size 3), for a total size of 256+540+3 = 799. The output is size 512.

The second VU has input size 512 and output size 512

However, the real-world contains multiple agents, each learning and acting independently to cooperate and compete with other agents, and environments reflecting this degree of complexity remain an open challenge. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that an agent can achieve human-level in a popular 3D multiplayer first-person video game, Quake III Arena Capture the Flag, using only pixels and game points as input. These results were achieved by a novel two-tier optimisation process in which a population of independent RL agents are trained concurrently from thousands of parallel matches with agents playing in teams together and against each other on randomly generated environments. Each agent in the population learns its own internal reward signal to complement the sparse delayed reward from winning, and selects actions using a novel temporally hierarchical representation that enables the agent to reason at multiple timescales.

We study this problem in the context of grasping, a longstanding challenge in robotic manipulation. In contrast to static learning behaviors that choose a grasp point and then execute the desired grasp, our method enables closed-loop vision-based control, whereby the robot continuously updates its grasp strategy based on the most recent observations to optimize long-horizon grasp success. To that end, we introduce QT-Opt, a scalable self-supervised vision-based reinforcement learning framework that can leverage over 580k real-world grasp attempts to train a deep neural network Q-function with over 1.2M parameters to perform closed-loop, real-world grasping that generalizes to 96% grasp success on unseen objects. Aside from attaining a very high success rate, our method exhibits behaviors that are quite distinct from more standard grasping systems: using only RGB vision-based perception from an over-the-shoulder camera, our method automatically learns regrasping strategies, probes objects to find the most effective grasps, learns to reposition objects and perform other non-prehensile pre-grasp manipulations, and responds dynamically to disturbances and perturbations.",2024-04-09 22:06,Anonymous,,0,"United States of America,United States of America",,,,,,,,,,,,"Industry,Academia",,,,,,,There is a public implementation of the architecture at https://github.com/quantumiracle/QT_Opt (not from any of the paper's co-authors),"Industry,Academia",,,

Significant improvements in the prediction of protein residue–residue contacts are observed in the recent years. These contacts, predicted using a variety of coevolution-based and machine learning methods, are the key contributors to the recent progress in ab initio protein structure prediction, as demonstrated in the recent CASP experiments. Continuing the development of new methods to reliably predict contact maps is essential to further improve ab initio structure prediction.

Results
In this paper we discuss DNCON2, an improved protein contact map predictor based on two-level deep convolutional neural networks. It consists of six convolutional neural networks—the first five predict contacts at 6, 7.5, 8, 8.5 and 10 Å distance thresholds, and the last one uses these five predictions as additional features to predict final contact maps. On the free-modeling datasets in CASP10, 11 and 12 experiments, DNCON2 achieves mean precisions of 35, 50 and 53.4%, respectively, higher than 30.6% by MetaPSICOV on CASP10 dataset, 34% by MetaPSICOV on CASP11 dataset and 46.3% by Raptor-X on CASP12 dataset, when top L/5 long-range contacts are evaluated. We attribute the improved performance of DNCON2 to the inclusion of short- and medium-range contacts into training, two-level approach to prediction, use of the state-of-the-art optimization and activation functions, and a novel deep learning architecture that allows each filter in a convolutional layer to access all the input features of a protein of arbitrary length.",2024-05-21 10:26,Anonymous,,,United States of America,,,,,,,,,,,,Academia,,,,,Open source,Open source,license: https://github.com/multicom-toolbox/DNCON2?tab=GPL-3.0-1-ov-file#readme,Academia,,,

Although both convolutional and recurrent architectures have a long history in sequence prediction, the current ""default"" mindset in much of
the deep learning community is that generic sequence modeling is best handled using recurrent networks.  The goal of this paper is to question this assumption. Specifically, we consider a simple generic temporal convolution network (TCN), which adopts features from modern ConvNet architectures such as a dilations and residual connections.  We show that on a variety of sequence modeling tasks, including many frequently used as benchmarks for evaluating recurrent networks, the TCN outperforms baseline RNN methods (LSTMs, GRUs, and vanilla RNNs) and sometimes even highly specialized approaches.  We further show that the potential ""infinite memory"" advantage that RNNs have over TCNs is largely absent in practice: TCNs indeed exhibit longer effective history sizes than their recurrent counterparts.   As a whole, we argue that it may be time to (re)consider ConvNets as the default ""go to"" architecture for sequence modeling.

Specifically, we propose to train two identical copies of an RNN (that share parameters) with different dropout masks while minimizing the difference between their (pre-softmax) predictions. In this way our regularization encourages the representations of RNNs to be invariant to dropout mask, thus being robust. We show that our regularization term is upper bounded by the expectation-linear dropout objective which has been shown to address the gap due to the difference between the train and inference phases of dropout.

Generally, deep neural network architectures are stacks consisting of a large number of convolutional layers, and they perform downsampling along the spatial dimension via pooling to reduce memory usage. Concurrently, the feature map dimension (i.e., the number of channels) is sharply increased at downsampling locations, which is essential to ensure effective performance because it increases the diversity of high-level attributes. This also applies to residual networks and is very closely related to their performance. In this research, instead of sharply increasing the feature map dimension at units that perform downsampling, we gradually increase the feature map dimension at all units to involve as many locations as possible. This design, which is discussed in depth together with our new insights, has proven to be an effective means of improving generalization ability. Furthermore, we propose a novel residual unit capable of further improving the classification accuracy with our new network architecture. Experiments on benchmark CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets have shown that our network architecture has superior generalization ability compared to the original residual networks.

The recurrence depth is extended by several intermediate hidden state units, and the weight parameters involved in determining these units are dynamically calculated. The motivation behind the paper lies on overcoming a deficiency in Recurrent Highway Networks and improving their performances which are currently at the forefront of RNNs: 1) Determining the appropriate number of recurrent depth in RHN for different tasks is a huge burden and just setting it to a large number is computationally wasteful with possible repercussion in terms of performance degradation and high latency. Expanding on the idea of adaptive computation time (ACT), with the use of an elastic gate in the form of a rectified exponentially decreasing function taking on as arguments as previous hidden state and input, the proposed model is able to evaluate the appropriate recurrent depth for each input. The rectified gating function enables the most significant intermediate hidden state updates to come early such that significant performance gain is achieved early. 2) Updating the weights from that of previous intermediate layer offers a richer representation than the use of shared weights across all intermediate recurrence layers. The weight update procedure is just an expansion of the idea underlying hypernetworks. To substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed network, we conducted three experiments: regression on synthetic data, human activity recognition, and language modeling on the Penn Treebank dataset. The proposed networks showed better performance than other state-of-the-art recurrent networks in all three experiments.",2024-05-21 10:27,Robi Rahman,EI-REHN-1200D,1,Korea (Republic of),,,,,,,,,,,,Academia,,,,,,,,Academia,,,

maintaining copies of the model on each card and split the

at the end we sum the gradients via Nvidia NCCL.

But the size of the biggest dataset has surprisingly remained constant. What will happen if we increase the dataset size by 10x or 100x? This paper takes a step towards clearing the clouds of mystery surrounding the relationship between `enormous data' and visual deep learning. By exploiting the JFT-300M dataset which has more than 375M noisy labels for 300M images, we investigate how the performance of current vision tasks would change if this data was used for representation learning. Our paper delivers some surprising (and some expected) findings. First, we find that the performance on vision tasks increases logarithmically based on volume of training data size. Second, we show that representation learning (or pre-training) still holds a lot of promise. One can improve performance on many vision tasks by just training a better base model.

element-wise multiplication of the ReLU outputs of these
two parallel layers produces the layer-wise output. The
combined layer is potentially more discriminative than the
original convolutional layer, and its inference is faster for
two reasons: 1) the zero cells of the LCCL feature maps will
remain zero after element-wise multiplication, and thus it is
safe to skip the calculation of the corresponding high-cost
convolution in the original convolutional layer; 2) LCCL
is very fast if it is implemented as a 1 × 1 convolution or
only a single filter shared by all channels. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ILSCRC-2012

However, the high computation intensity of DNNs makes it challenging to deploy these models on resource-limited systems. Some studies used low-rank approaches that approximate the filters by low-rank basis to accelerate the testing. Those works directly decomposed the pre-trained DNNs by Low-Rank Approximations (LRA). How to train DNNs toward lower-rank space for more efficient DNNs, however, remains as an open area. To solve the issue, in this work, we propose Force Regularization, which uses attractive forces to enforce filters so as to coordinate more weight information into lower-rank space. We mathematically and empirically verify that after applying our technique, standard LRA methods can reconstruct filters using much lower basis and thus result in faster DNNs. The effectiveness of our approach is comprehensively evaluated in ResNets, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet. In AlexNet, for example, Force Regularization gains 2x speedup on modern GPU without accuracy loss and 4.05x speedup on CPU by paying small accuracy degradation. Moreover, Force Regularization better initializes the low-rank DNNs such that the fine-tuning can converge faster toward higher accuracy.

An ARF acts as a virtual filter bank containing the filter itself and its multiple unmaterialised rotated versions. During back-propagation, an ARF is collectively updated using errors from all its rotated versions. DCNNs using ARFs, referred to as Oriented Response Networks (ORNs), can produce within-class rotation-invariant deep features while maintaining inter-class discrimination for classification tasks. The oriented response produced by ORNs can also be used for image and object orientation estimation tasks. Over multiple state-of-the-art DCNN architectures, such as VGG, ResNet, and STN, we consistently observe that replacing regular filters with the proposed ARFs leads to significant reduction in the number of network parameters and improvement in classification performance.

Our CIFAR-10 model achieves a test error rate of 3.65, which is 0.09 percent better and 1.05x faster than the previous state-of-the-art model that used a similar architectural scheme. On the Penn Treebank dataset, our model can compose a novel recurrent cell that outperforms the widely-used LSTM cell, and other state-of-the-art baselines. Our cell achieves a test set perplexity of 62.4 on the Penn Treebank, which is 3.6 perplexity better than the previous state-of-the-art model. The cell can also be transferred to the character language modeling task on PTB and achieves a state-of-the-art perplexity of 1.214.",2024-04-26 17:35,Robi Rahman,,0,United States of America,,,,800,,NASv3 (CIFAR-10),,,,,,Industry,,,,,,,,Industry,,,

Unfortunately, NMT systems are known to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation inference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words. These issues have hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both accuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google's Neural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder layers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final translation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference computations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited set of common sub-word units (""wordpieces"") for both input and output. This method provides a good balance between the flexibility of ""character""-delimited models and the efficiency of ""word""-delimited models, naturally handles translation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the system. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and uses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that is most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. On the WMT'14 English-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive results to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of isolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60% compared to Google's phrase-based production system.",2024-05-21 10:31,Robi Rahman,,0,United States of America,,,,,,GNMT,,,,,,Industry,,,,655730,,,presumably deployed via Google translate,Industry,,,

We propose a simple architecture, called SimpleNet, based on a set of designing principles, with which we empirically show, a well-crafted yet simple and reasonably deep architecture can perform on par with deeper and more complex architectures. SimpleNet provides a good tradeoff between the computation/memory efficiency and the accuracy. Our simple 13-layer architecture outperforms most of the deeper and complex architectures to date such as VGGNet, ResNet, and GoogleNet on several well-known benchmarks while having 2 to 25 times fewer number of parameters and operations. This makes it very handy for embedded systems or systems with computational and memory limitations. We achieved state-of-theart result on CIFAR10 outperforming several heavier architectures, near state of the art on MNIST and highly competitive results on CIFAR100 and SVHN. We also outperformed the much larger and deeper architectures such as VGGNet and popular variants of ResNets among others on the ImageNet dataset.

We use this scheme to learn to perform inference in partially specified 2D models (variable-sized variational auto-encoders) and fully specified 3D models (probabilistic renderers). We show that such models learn to identify multiple objects – counting, locating and classifying the elements of a scene – without any supervision, e.g., decomposing 3D images with various numbers of objects in a single forward pass of a neural network at unprecedented speed.

further show that the networks produce accurate inferences when compared to supervised counterparts, and that their structure leads to improved generalization.",2024-05-24 20:03,Anonymous,,,Multinational,,,,,,,,,,,,Industry,,,,,,,,Industry,,,

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks’ to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks’ to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.",2024-04-01 10:35,Robi Rahman,,,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,,,,,AlphaGo Lee,,,,,,Industry,,,,,,,,Industry,,,

We first describe an operator for tabular representations, the consistent Bellman operator, which incorporates a notion of local policy consistency. We show that this local consistency leads to an increase in the action gap at each state; increasing this gap, we argue, mitigates the undesirable effects of approximation and estimation errors on the induced greedy policies. This operator can also be applied to discretized continuous space and time problems, and we provide empirical results evidencing superior performance in this context. Extending the idea of a locally consistent operator, we then derive sufficient conditions for an operator to preserve optimality, leading to a family of operators which includes our consistent Bellman operator. As corollaries we provide a proof of optimality for Baird's advantage learning algorithm and derive other gap-increasing operators with interesting properties. We conclude with an empirical study on 60 Atari 2600 games illustrating the strong potential of these new operators.",2024-05-21 14:01,Robi Rahman,,,Multinational,,,,,,,,,,,,Industry,,,,,,,,Industry,,,

Key to our approach is our application of HPC techniques, resulting in a 7x speedup over our previous system. Because of this efficiency, experiments that previously took weeks now run in days. This enables us to iterate more quickly to identify superior architectures and algorithms. As a result, in several cases, our system is competitive with the transcription of human workers when benchmarked on standard datasets.

PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on our PReLU networks (PReLU-nets), we achieve 4.94% top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26% relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66%).

Max-pooling act on the hidden layers of the network, reducing their size by an integer multiplicative factor alpha. The amazing by-product of discarding 75% of your data is that you build into the network a degree of invariance with respect to translations and elastic distortions. However, if you simply alternate convolutional layers with max-pooling layers, performance is limited due to the rapid reduction in spatial size, and the disjoint nature of the pooling regions. We have formulated a fractional version of max-pooling where alpha is allowed to take non-integer values. Our version of max-pooling is stochastic as there are lots of different ways of constructing suitable pooling regions. We find that our form of fractional max-pooling reduces overfitting on a variety of datasets: for instance, we improve on the state-of-the art for CIFAR-100 without even using dropout.",2024-03-07 15:22,Anonymous,,,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,,,,,,,,,,,Academia,,,,,,,,Academia,,,

We introduce the structure-content neural language model that disentangles the structure of a sentence to its content, conditioned on representations produced by the encoder. The encoder allows one to rank images and sentences while the decoder can generate novel descriptions from scratch.

However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different thinned networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.",2024-05-09 13:39,Natalia Martemianova,,,Canada,,,,,,,,,,,,Academia,,,,,Open source,,http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nitish/dropout,Academia,,,

""",,Unsupervised,,Hardware not reported,Industry,Likely,"We consider the problem of building high-level, class-specific feature detectors from only unlabeled data. For example, is it possible to learn a face detector using only unlabeled images using unlabeled images? To answer this, we train a 9-layered locally connected sparse autoencoder with pooling and local contrast normalization on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 billion connections, the dataset has 10 million 200×200 pixel images downloaded from the Internet). We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous SGD on a cluster with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental results reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature detector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane rotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level concepts such as cat faces and human bodies. Starting with these learned features, we trained our network to obtain 15.8% accuracy in recognizing 20,000 object categories from ImageNet, a leap of 70% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.",2024-03-07 15:22,Anonymous,,,United States of America,,,,,,,,,,,,Industry,,,,,,,,Industry,,,

However, CIFAR-10 is a labeled subset of all the training data used

""The tiny images dataset on which we based all of our experiments was collected by colleagues at MIT and NYU over the span of six months; it is described in detail in [14]. They assembled it by searching the web for images of every non-abstract English noun in the lexical database WordNet[15, 8]. They used several search engines, including Google, Flickr, and Altavista and kept roughly the rst 3000 results for each search term. After collecting all the images for a particular search term, they removed perfect duplicates and images in which an excessively large portion of the pixels were white, as they tended to be synthetic gures rather than natural images. The search term used to nd an image provides it with a rough label, although it is extremely unreliable due to the nature of online image search technology.
In total, the dataset contains 80 million colour images downscaled to 32 × 32 and spread out across 79000 search terms. Most of our experiments with unsupervised learning were performed on a subset of about 2 million images.""

""We paid students to label a subset of the tiny images dataset... We call this the CIFAR-10 dataset, after the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, which funded the project""",2000000,,,,,,,,,,,,Likely,"Groups at MIT and NYU have collected a dataset of millions of tiny colour images from the web. It
is, in principle, an excellent dataset for unsupervised training of deep generative models, but previous
researchers who have tried this have found it dicult to learn a good set of lters from the images.
We show how to train a multi-layer generative model that learns to extract meaningful features which
resemble those found in the human visual cortex. Using a novel parallelization algorithm to distribute
the work among multiple machines connected on a network, we show how training such a model can be
done in reasonable time.
A second problematic aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels
which makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments. We created two sets of reliable labels.
The CIFAR-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the CIFAR-100 set has 600 examples of
each of 100 non-overlapping classes. Using these labels, we show that object recognition is signicantly
improved by pre-training a layer of features on a large set of unlabeled tiny images.",2024-04-01 10:52,Anonymous,,,Canada,,,,,,,,,,,,Academia,,,,,,,,Academia,,,

We present a method for learning object categories from just a few images (1 /spl sim/ 5). It is based on incorporating ""generic"" knowledge which may be obtained from previously learnt models of unrelated categories. We operate in a variational Bayesian framework: object categories are represented by probabilistic models, and ""prior"" knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The ""posterior"" model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. Our ideas are demonstrated on four diverse categories (human faces, airplanes, motorcycles, spotted cats). Initially three categories are learnt from hundreds of training examples, and a ""prior"" is estimated from these. Then the model of the fourth category is learnt from 1 to 5 training examples, and is used for detecting new exemplars a set of test images.",2024-03-07 15:22,Anonymous,,,"United States of America,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",,,,,,,,,,,,"Academia,Academia",,,,,,,,"Academia,Academia",,,

- Translation probability model phi
- The distortion probability distribution d
- A langage model p_LM
- A length factor w

Several translation probability models are considered. The most performant one is the AP word alignment model. The sentence length preferred by the authors is 3 words maximum. In the biggest corpus considered (320k phrase pairs) it produces a phrase translation probability table of 1996k entries.

The distortion probability model d is taken from  (Marcu and Wong, 2002).

The distortion probability model must have ~10 parameters at most

The language model p_LM is a back off trigram model from (Seymore and Rosenfeld,1997). AFAIK the cutoff used is not specified. Based on the example on section 4.3 of (Seymore and Rosefeld, 1997), a trigram probability model has about 3866964 + 2674322 + 641604 parameters.

""For each possible phrase translation anywhere in the sentence (we call it a translation option), we multiply its phrase translation probability with the language model probability for the generated English phrase. As language model probability we use the unigram probability for the first word, the bigram probability for the second, and the trigram probability for all following words""

The length factor w is an additional single parameter.

""In order to calibrate the output length, we introduce a
factor w for each generated English word in addition to
the trigram language model ""

Our research has focused on how a multilayer feedforward structure performs in the particular problem of particle characterization. The proposed procedure, after suitable data preprocessing, consists of two distinct phases: in the former, a feedforward neural network is used to obtain an image data compression. In the latter, a neural classifier is trained on the compressed data. All the tests have been conducted on a sample constituted by two different typologies of ceramic particles, each characterized by a different microstructure. The sample image of different particles acquired and directly digitalized by scanning electron microscopy has been processed in order to achieve the best conditions to obtain the boundary profile of each particle. The boundary is thus assumed to be representative of the morphological characteristics of the ceramic products. Using the neural approach, a classification accuracy as high as 100% on a training set of 80 sub-images was achieved.

A training multilayer fully connected network of ADALINE neurons is proposed as a preprocessing step for invariant image extraction. A second neural network has been trained by the popular backpropagation algorithm for recovering the real image without distortions. First, the sample invariants are obtained by the preprocessing network. In the second step, the general invariant that includes all the sample invariants is computed. Afterward, the reordered sample invariants are input to a multilayer neural network trained by the backpropagation algorithm. The original image, without distortions, is obtained in the output of this system. Several test images have been computed, and evaluation of the results shows that in the case of images with intrinsic perceptual similarity, the learning procedure leads to a global invariant extraction that requires less computational effort in comparison with an arbitrary training selection.

",,,,,5,"""Five training patterns used for the self-organization are shown in Fig. 4""",,,,,,,,,,,Unverified,"A hierarchical neural network model with feedback interconnections, which has the function of associative memory and the ability to recognize patterns, is proposed. The model consists of a hierarchical multi-layered network to which efferent connections are added, so as to make positive feedback loops in pairs with afferent connections. The cell-layer at the initial stage of the network is the input layer which receives the stimulus input and at the same time works as an output layer for associative recall. The deepest layer is the output layer for pattern-recognition. Pattern-recognition is performed hierarchically by integrating information by converging afferent paths in the network. For the purpose of associative recall, the integrated information is again distributed to lower-order cells by diverging efferent paths. These two operations progress simultaneously in the network. If a fragment of a training pattern is presented to the network which has completed its self-organization, the entire pattern will gradually be recalled in the initial layer. If a stimulus consisting of a number of training patterns superposed is presented, one pattern gradually becomes predominant in the recalled output after competition between the patterns, and the others disappear. At about the same time when the recalled pattern reaches a steady state in he initial layer, in the deepest layer of the network, a response is elicited from the cell corresponding to the category of the finally-recalled pattern. Once a steady state has been reached, the response of the network is automatically extinguished by inhibitory signals from a steadiness-detecting cell. If the same stimulus is still presented after inhibition, a response for another pattern, formerly suppressed, will now appear, because the cells of the network have adaptation characteristics which makes the same response unlikely to recur. Since inhibition occurs repeatedly, the superposed input patterns are recalled one by one in turn.",2024-05-20 10:42,Lovis Heindrich,,,Japan,,,,,,,,,,,,Industry,,,,,,,,Industry,,,

The task is to balance a pole that is hinged to a movable cart by applying forces to the cart's base. It is argued that the learning problems faced by adaptive elements that are components of adaptive networks are at least as difficult as this version of the pole-balancing problem. The learning system consists of a single associative search element (ASE) and a single adaptive critic element (ACE). In the course of learning to balance the pole, the ASE constructs associations between input and output by searching under the influence of reinforcement feedback, and the ACE constructs a more informative evaluation function than reinforcement feedback alone can provide.

Next the abnormal cases were divided into two groups depending on whether the QRS duration was more than 0.12 seconds or less.

The controller is capable of controlling a plant that may be nonlinear and nonstationary. The only a priori information required by the controller is the order of the plant. The approach is to design a controller which partitions the control measurement space into sets called control situations and then learns the best control choice for each control situation. The control measurements are those indicating the state of the plant and environment. The learning is accomplished by reinforcement of the probability of choosing a particular control choice for a given control situation. The system was stimulated on an IBM 1710-GEDA hybrid computer facility.

The receptor makes certain measurements on the unknown pattern to be recognized; the categorizer determines from these measurements the particular allowable pattern class to which the unknown pattern belongs. This paper is concerned with the study of a particular class of categorizers, the linear decision function. The optimum linear decision function is the best linear approximation to the optimum decision function in the following sense: 1) ""Optimum"" is taken to mean minimum loss (which includes minimum error systems). 2) ""Linear"" is taken to mean that each pair of pattern classes is separated by one and only one hyperplane in the measurement space. This class of categorizers is of practical interest for two reasons: 1) It can be empirically designed without making any assumptions whatsoever about either the distribution of the receptor measurements or the a priori probabilities of occurrence of the pattern classes, providing an appropriate pattern source is available. 2) Its implementation is quite simple and inexpensive. Various properties of linear decision functions are discussed. One such property is that a linear decision function is guaranteed to perform at least as well as a minimum distance categorizer. Procedures are then developed for the estimation (or design) of the optimum linear decision function based upon an appropriate sampling from the pattern classes to be categorized.",2024-05-20 11:06,Anonymous,,0,United States of America,,,,,,,,,,,,Industry,,,,,,,,Industry,,,

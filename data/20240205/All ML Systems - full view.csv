address this by training a bespoke image captioner and use it to recaption the

However, autonomous parkour requires robots to learn generalizable skills that are both vision-based and diverse to perceive and react to various scenarios. In this work, we propose a system for learning a single end-to-end vision-based parkour policy of diverse parkour skills using a simple reward without any reference motion data. We develop a reinforcement learning method inspired by direct collocation to generate parkour skills, including climbing over high obstacles, leaping over large gaps, crawling beneath low barriers, squeezing through thin slits, and running. We distill these skills into a single vision-based parkour policy and transfer it to a quadrupedal robot using its egocentric depth camera. We demonstrate that our system can empower two different low-cost robots to autonomously select and execute appropriate parkour skills to traverse challenging real-world environments.",,,,Likely,2024-02-01 10:25,Anonymous,,"China,United States of America,United States of America,China","Shanghai Qi Zhi institute, Stanford University, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Tsinghua University",,,,Robot Parkour,,,,

Specifically, the parallel representation allows for training parallelism. The recurrent representation enables low-cost O(1) inference, which improves decoding throughput, latency, and GPU memory without sacrificing performance. The chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear complexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly while recurrently summarizing the chunks. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet achieves favorable scaling results, parallel training, low-cost deployment, and efficient inference.

We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of Transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, which parallelizes computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference, leading to the first non-transformer architecture to be scaled to tens of billions of parameters. Our experiments reveal that RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting that future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models.

The former paradigm is limited by inflexibility in applications while in the latter, the model is treated as a single system for all tasks, leading to suboptimal performance on a subset of tasks. Secondly, they often employ a limited set of pretraining objectives which might not be relevant to some downstream tasks and hence result in substantial performance degrade.

For data distributions, the effect of a mixture distribution and multi-epoch training of programming and natural languages on model performance is explored.

We present Perfusion, a T2I personalization method that addresses these challenges using dynamic rank-1 updates to the underlying T2I model. Perfusion avoids overfitting by introducing a new mechanism that ""locks"" new concepts' cross-attention Keys to their superordinate category. Additionally, we develop a gated rank-1 approach that enables us to control the influence of a learned concept during inference time and to combine multiple concepts. This allows runtime-efficient balancing of visual-fidelity and textual-alignment with a single 100KB trained model, which is five orders of magnitude smaller than the current state of the art. Moreover, it can span different operating points across the Pareto front without additional training.

We used Deep RL to train a humanoid robot with 20 actuated joints to play a simplified one-versus-one (1v1) soccer game. We first trained individual skills in isolation and then composed those skills end-to-end in a self-play setting. The resulting policy exhibits robust and dynamic movement skills such as rapid fall recovery, walking, turning, kicking and more; and transitions between them in a smooth, stable, and efficient manner - well beyond what is intuitively expected from the robot. The agents also developed a basic strategic understanding of the game, and learned, for instance, to anticipate ball movements and to block opponent shots. The full range of behaviors emerged from a small set of simple rewards. Our agents were trained in simulation and transferred to real robots zero-shot. We found that a combination of sufficiently high-frequency control, targeted dynamics randomization, and perturbations during training in simulation enabled good-quality transfer, despite significant unmodeled effects and variations across robot instances. Although the robots are inherently fragile, minor hardware modifications together with basic regularization of the behavior during training led the robots to learn safe and effective movements while still performing in a dynamic and agile way. Indeed, even though the agents were optimized for scoring, in experiments they walked 156% faster, took 63% less time to get up, and kicked 24% faster than a scripted baseline, while efficiently combining the skills to achieve the longer term objectives.

Our model is the first generative model that is able to directly perform zero-shot code infilling, which we evaluate on challenging tasks such as type inference, comment generation, and variable re-naming. We find that the ability to condition on bidirectional context substantially improves performance on these tasks, while still performing comparably on standard program synthesis benchmarks in comparison to left-to-right only models pretrained at similar scale. The InCoder models and code are publicly released. this https URL",,Permissive license,,Confident,2024-02-01 10:08,Anonymous,0,"Multinational,United States of America,United States of America,United States of America,United States of America","Facebook AI Research, University of Washington, UC Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago",,,,,,,,

We find strong evidence in support of this hypothesis across three different experiments, each of which reveal different facets of moral self-correction. We find that the capability for moral self-correction emerges at 22B model parameters, and typically improves with increasing model size and RLHF training. We believe that at this level of scale, language models obtain two capabilities that they can use for moral self-correction: (1) they can follow instructions and (2) they can learn complex normative concepts of harm like stereotyping, bias, and discrimination. As such, they can follow instructions to avoid certain kinds of morally harmful outputs.

Our method discovers a simple and effective optimization algorithm, Lion (EvoLved Sign Momentum). It is more memory-efficient than Adam as it only keeps track of the momentum. Different from adaptive optimizers, its update has the same magnitude for each parameter calculated through the sign operation. We compare Lion with widely used optimizers, such as Adam and Adafactor, for training a variety of models on different tasks. On image classification, Lion boosts the accuracy of ViT by up to 2% on ImageNet and saves up to 5x the pre-training compute on JFT. On vision-language contrastive learning, we achieve 88.3% zero-shot and 91.1% fine-tuning accuracy on ImageNet, surpassing the previous best results by 2% and 0.1%, respectively. On diffusion models, Lion outperforms Adam by achieving a better FID score and reducing the training compute by up to 2.3x. For autoregressive, masked language modeling, and fine-tuning, Lion exhibits a similar or better performance compared to Adam. Our analysis of Lion reveals that its performance gain grows with the training batch size. It also requires a smaller learning rate than Adam due to the larger norm of the update produced by the sign function. Additionally, we examine the limitations of Lion and identify scenarios where its improvements are small or not statistically significant.

By leveraging text as the underlying goal specification, we are able to naturally and combinatorially generalize to novel goals. The proposed policy-as-video formulation can further represent environments with different state and action spaces in a unified space of images, which, for example, enables learning and generalization across a variety of robot manipulation tasks.

To alleviate this problem, we propose a very simple but effective training regularization, consisting in perturbing the ground truth samples to simulate the inference time prediction errors. We empirically show that, without affecting the recall and precision, the proposed input perturbation leads to a significant improvement in the sample quality while reducing both the training and the inference times.

This paper proposes UL2R, a method that substantially improves existing language models and their scaling curves with a relatively tiny amount of extra compute. The key idea is to continue training a state-of-the-art large language model (e.g., PaLM) on a few more steps with UL2's mixture-of-denoiser objective. We show that, with almost negligible extra computational costs and no new sources of data, we are able to substantially improve the scaling properties of large language models on downstream metrics. In this paper, we continue training PaLM with UL2R, introducing a new set of models at 8B, 62B, and 540B scale which we call U-PaLM. Impressively, at 540B scale, we show an approximately 2x computational savings rate where U-PaLM achieves the same performance as the final PaLM 540B model at around half its computational budget (i.e., saving ∼4.4 million TPUv4 hours). We further show that this improved scaling curve leads to 'emergent abilities' on challenging BIG-Bench tasks -- for instance, U-PaLM does much better than PaLM on some tasks or demonstrates better quality at much smaller scale (62B as opposed to 540B). Overall, we show that U-PaLM outperforms PaLM on many few-shot setups, i.e., English NLP tasks (e.g., commonsense reasoning, question answering), reasoning tasks with chain-of-thought (e.g., GSM8K), multilingual tasks (MGSM, TydiQA), MMLU and challenging BIG-Bench tasks.

We demonstrate that this breakdown enables us to collect more targeted human judgements of agent behaviour and allows for more efficient rule-conditional reward models. Second, our agent provides evidence from sources supporting factual claims when collecting preference judgements over model statements. For factual questions, evidence provided by Sparrow supports the sampled response 78% of the time.

A major drawback of these models is their size in terms of the number of parameters needed to be fitted and the amount of computational resources they require. Recently, 'distilled' models using the concept of student and teacher networks have been widely used in NLP. Here, we adapted this concept to the problem of protein sequence analysis, by developing DistilProtBert, a distilled version of the successful ProtBert model. Implementing this approach, we reduced the size of the network and the running time by 50%, and the computational resources needed for pretraining by 98% relative to ProtBert model. Using two published tasks, we showed that the performance of the distilled model approaches that of the full model. We next tested the ability of DistilProtBert to distinguish between real and random protein sequences. The task is highly challenging if the composition is maintained on the level of singlet, doublet and triplet amino acids. Indeed, traditional machine-learning algorithms have difficulties with this task. Here, we show that DistilProtBert preforms very well on singlet, doublet and even triplet-shuffled versions of the human proteome, with AUC of 0.92, 0.91 and 0.87, respectively. Finally, we suggest that by examining the small number of false-positive classifications (i.e. shuffled sequences classified as proteins by DistilProtBert), we may be able to identify de novo potential natural-like proteins based on random shuffling of amino acid sequences.",,,,Likely,2024-02-02 18:18,Anonymous,,Israel,Bar-Ilan University,,,,,,,,

What does it take to break the 200 language barrier while ensuring safe, high quality results, all while keeping ethical considerations in mind? In No Language Left Behind, we took on this challenge by first contextualizing the need for low-resource language translation support through exploratory interviews with native speakers. Then, we created datasets and models aimed at narrowing the performance gap between low and high-resource languages. More specifically, we developed a conditional compute model based on Sparsely Gated Mixture of Experts that is trained on data obtained with novel and effective data mining techniques tailored for low-resource languages.

Such paradigm largely ignores some important but potentially useful signals in the problem specification such as unit tests, which thus often results in poor performance when solving complex unseen coding tasks. To address the limitations, we propose ""CodeRL"", a new framework for program synthesis tasks through pretrained LMs and deep reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, during training, we treat the code-generating LM as an actor network, and introduce a critic network that is trained to predict the functional correctness of generated programs and provide dense feedback signals to the actor. During inference, we introduce a new generation procedure with a critical sampling strategy that allows a model to automatically regenerate programs based on feedback from example unit tests and critic scores. For the model backbones, we extended the encoder-decoder architecture of CodeT5 with enhanced learning objectives, larger model sizes, and better pretraining data.

This paper presents Contrastive Captioner (CoCa), a minimalist design to pretrain an image-text encoder-decoder foundation model jointly with contrastive loss and captioning loss, thereby subsuming model capabilities from contrastive approaches like CLIP and generative methods like SimVLM. In contrast to standard encoder-decoder transformers where all decoder layers attend to encoder outputs, CoCa omits cross-attention in the first half of decoder layers to encode unimodal text representations, and cascades the remaining decoder layers which cross-attend to the image encoder for multimodal image-text representations. We apply a contrastive loss between unimodal image and text embeddings, in addition to a captioning loss on the multimodal decoder outputs which predicts text tokens autoregressively. By sharing the same computational graph, the two training objectives are computed efficiently with minimal overhead. CoCa is pretrained end-to-end and from scratch on both web-scale alt-text data and annotated images by treating all labels simply as text, seamlessly unifying natural language supervision for representation learning.

Diffusion-GAN consists of three components, including an adaptive diffusion process, a diffusion timestep-dependent discriminator, and a generator. Both the observed and generated data are diffused by the same adaptive diffusion process. At each diffusion timestep, there is a different noise-to-data ratio and the timestep-dependent discriminator learns to distinguish the diffused real data from the diffused generated data. The generator learns from the discriminator’s feedback by backpropagating through the forward diffusion chain, whose length is adaptively adjusted to balance the noise and data levels. We theoretically show that the discriminator’s timestep-dependent strategy gives consistent and helpful guidance to the generator, enabling it to match the true data distribution.

We find that dropout acts as minimal data augmentation, and removing it leads to a representation collapse. Then, we propose a supervised approach, which incorporates annotated pairs from natural language inference datasets into our contrastive learning framework by using ""entailment"" pairs as positives and ""contradiction"" pairs as hard negatives. We evaluate SimCSE on standard semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, and our unsupervised and supervised models using BERT base achieve an average of 76.3% and 81.6% Spearman's correlation respectively, a 4.2% and 2.2% improvement compared to the previous best results.

However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner.

""To narrow the universe of molecules we chose to drive the generative model towards compounds like the nerve agent VX, one of the most toxic chemical warfare agents developed during the 20th century—a few salt-sized grains of VX, (6–10 mg)5, is sufficient to kill a person. Nerve agents such as Novichoks have also been in the headlines recently6.

In less than 6 hours after starting on our in-house server, our model generated forty thousand molecules that scored within our desired threshold. In the process, the AI designed not only VX, but many other known chemical warfare agents that we identified through visual confirmation with structures in public chemistry databases. Many new molecules were also designed that looked equally plausible. These new molecules were predicted to be more toxic based on the predicted LD50 in comparison to publicly known chemical warfare agents (Figure 1). This was unexpected as the datasets we used for training the AI did not include these nerve agents. The virtual molecules even occupied a region of molecular property space that was entirely separate to the many thousands of molecules in the organism-specific LD50 model, which is mainly made up of pesticides, environmental toxins, and drugs (Figure 1). By inverting the use of our machine learning models, we had transformed our innocuous generative model from a helpful tool of medicine to a generator of likely deadly molecules.""",,"model details here: https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/61551803d1fc335b7cf8fd45

The first challenge, safety, involves ensuring that the model's responses are consistent with a set of human values, such as preventing harmful suggestions and unfair bias. We quantify safety using a metric based on an illustrative set of human values, and we find that filtering candidate responses using a LaMDA classifier fine-tuned with a small amount of crowdworker-annotated data offers a promising approach to improving model safety. The second challenge, factual grounding, involves enabling the model to consult external knowledge sources, such as an information retrieval system, a language translator, and a calculator. We quantify factuality using a groundedness metric, and we find that our approach enables the model to generate responses grounded in known sources, rather than responses that merely sound plausible.

Developing systems that can assist programmers or even generate programs independently could make programming more productive and
accessible, yet so far incorporating innovations in AI has proven challenging. Recent large-scale language models have demonstrated an impressive ability to generate code, and are now able to complete
simple programming tasks. However, these models still perform poorly when evaluated on more complex, unseen problems that require problem-solving skills beyond simply translating instructions into
code. For example, competitive programming problems which require an understanding of algorithms
and complex natural language remain extremely challenging. To address this gap, we introduce AlphaCode, a system for code generation that can create novel solutions to these problems that require deeper
reasoning. In simulated evaluations on recent programming competitions on the Codeforces platform,
AlphaCode achieved on average a ranking of top 54.3% in competitions with more than 5,000 participants. We found that three key components were critical to achieve good and reliable performance:
(1) an extensive and clean competitive programming dataset for training and evaluation, (2) large and
efficient-to-sample transformer-based architectures, and (3) large-scale model sampling to explore the
search space, followed by filtering based on program behavior to a small set of submissions.

The training and inference costs of these models, however, have grown rapidly and become prohibitively expensive. Here we aim to reduce the costs of Transformers by searching for a more efficient variant. Compared to previous approaches, our search is performed at a lower level, over the primitives that define a Transformer TensorFlow program. We identify an architecture, named Primer, that has a smaller training cost than the original Transformer and other variants for auto-regressive language modeling. Primer's improvements can be mostly attributed to two simple modifications: squaring ReLU activations and adding a depthwise convolution layer after each Q, K, and V projection in self-attention. Experiments show Primer's gains over Transformer increase as compute scale grows and follow a power law with respect to quality at optimal model sizes. We also verify empirically that Primer can be dropped into different codebases to significantly speed up training without additional tuning. For example, at a 500M parameter size, Primer improves the original T5 architecture on C4 auto-regressive language modeling, reducing the training cost by 4X. Furthermore, the reduced training cost means Primer needs much less compute to reach a target one-shot performance. For instance, in a 1.9B parameter configuration similar to GPT-3 XL, Primer uses 1/3 of the training compute to achieve the same one-shot performance as Transformer.

In this work, we explore the limits of contrastive learning as a way to train unsupervised dense retrievers and show that it leads to strong performance in various retrieval settings. On the BEIR benchmark our unsupervised model outperforms BM25 on 11 out of 15 datasets for the Recall@100. When used as pre-training before fine-tuning, either on a few thousands in-domain examples or on the large MS~MARCO dataset, our contrastive model leads to improvements on the BEIR benchmark. Finally, we evaluate our approach for multi-lingual retrieval, where training data is even scarcer than for English, and show that our approach leads to strong unsupervised performance. Our model also exhibits strong cross-lingual transfer when fine-tuned on supervised English data only and evaluated on low resources language such as Swahili. We show that our unsupervised models can perform cross-lingual retrieval between different scripts, such as retrieving English documents from Arabic queries, which would not be possible with term matching methods.",,Permissive license,,Likely,2024-02-02 18:18,Anonymous,0,"Multinational,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,France,France","Meta AI, University College London (UCL), PSL University, Université Grenoble Alpes",BERT-Large,,actually BERT base,,,,,

Furthermore, recent years have witnessed an exponential growth of the model scale--from Google's 2016 model with 1 billion parameters to the latest Facebook's model with 12 trillion parameters. Significant quality boost has come with each jump of the model capacity, which makes us believe the era of 100 trillion parameters is around the corner. However, the training of such models is challenging even within industrial scale data centers. This difficulty is inherited from the staggering heterogeneity of the training computation--the model's embedding layer could include more than 99.99% of the total model size, which is extremely memory-intensive; while the rest neural network is increasingly computation-intensive. To support the training of such huge models, an efficient distributed training system is in urgent need. In this paper, we resolve this challenge by careful co-design of both the optimization algorithm and the distributed system architecture. Specifically, in order to ensure both the training efficiency and the training accuracy, we design a novel hybrid training algorithm, where the embedding layer and the dense neural network are handled by different synchronization mechanisms; then we build a system called Persia (short for parallel recommendation training system with hybrid acceleration) to support this hybrid training algorithm. Both theoretical demonstration and empirical study up to 100 trillion parameters have conducted to justified the system design and implementation of Persia.

While existing vision foundation models such as CLIP, ALIGN, and Wu Dao 2.0 focus mainly on mapping images and textual representations to a cross-modal shared representation, we introduce a new computer vision foundation model, Florence, to expand the representations from coarse (scene) to fine (object), from static (images) to dynamic (videos), and from RGB to multiple modalities (caption, depth).

Moreover, Florence demonstrates outstanding performance in many types of transfer learning: fully sampled fine-tuning, linear probing, few-shot transfer and zero-shot transfer for novel images and objects. All of these properties are critical for our vision foundation model to serve general purpose vision tasks.

For instance, on 5 test sets with natural distribution shifts such as ImageNet-{A,R,V2,Sketch} and ObjectNet, our model achieves 84.3% top-1 average accuracy, only a small drop from its original ImageNet accuracy.

We present CodeT5, a unified pre-trained encoder-decoder Transformer model that better leverages the code semantics conveyed from the developer-assigned identifiers. Our model employs a unified framework to seamlessly support both code understanding and generation tasks and allows for multi-task learning. Besides, we propose a novel identifier-aware pre-training task that enables the model to distinguish which code tokens are identifiers and to recover them when they are masked. Furthermore, we propose to exploit the user-written code comments with a bimodal dual generation task for better NL-PL alignment. Comprehensive experiments show that CodeT5 significantly outperforms prior methods on understanding tasks such as code defect detection and clone detection, and generation tasks across various directions including PL-NL, NL-PL, and PL-PL.

We achieve this by (i) designing the ZionEX platform with dedicated scale-out network, provisioned with high bandwidth, optimal topology and efficient transport (ii) implementing an optimized PyTorch-based training stack supporting both model and data parallelism (iii) developing sharding algorithms capable of hierarchical partitioning of the embedding tables along row, column dimensions and load balancing them across multiple workers; (iv) adding high-performance core operators while retaining flexibility to support optimizers with fully deterministic updates (v) leveraging reduced precision communications, multi-level memory hierarchy (HBM+DDR+SSD) and pipelining. Furthermore, we develop and briefly comment on distributed data ingestion and other supporting services that are required for the robust and efficient end-to-end training in production environments.",,,,,2024-02-01 09:59,Robi Rahman,,Multinational,Facebook,,,,,,,,

- ""Each agent is trained using 8 TPUv3s and consumes approximately 50,000 agent steps (observations) per second.""
- TPUv3 (half precision): 4.2e14 FLOP/s
- Number of TPUs: 8
- Utilisation rate: 0.1

[Timesteps]
- Figure 16 shows steps per generation and agent. In total there are 1.5e10 + 4.0e10 + 2.5e10 + 1.1e11 + 2e11 = 3.9e11 steps per agent.
- 3.9e11 / 5e4 = 8e6 s → ~93 days
- 100 million steps is equivalent to 30 minutes of wall-clock time in our setup. (pg 29, fig 27)
- 1e8 steps → 0.5h
- 3.9e11 steps → 1950h → 7.0e6 s → ~82 days
- Both of these seem like overestimates, because:
“Finally, on the largest timescale (days), generational training iteratively improves population performance by bootstrapping off previous generations, whilst also iteratively updating the validation normalised percentile metric itself.” (pg 16)
- Suggests that the above is an overestimate of the number of days needed, else they would have said (months) or (weeks)?
- Final choice (guesstimate): 85 days = 7.3e6 s

[Population size]
- 8 agents? (pg 21) → this is describing the case where they’re not using PBT, so ignore this number
- The original PBT paper uses 32 agents for one task https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09846.pdf (in general it uses between 10 and 80)

We define a universe of tasks within an environment domain and demonstrate the ability to train agents that are generally capable across this vast space and beyond. The environment is natively multi-agent, spanning the continuum of competitive, cooperative, and independent games, which are situated within procedurally generated physical 3D worlds. The resulting space is exceptionally diverse in terms of the challenges posed to agents, and as such, even measuring the learning progress of an agent is an open research problem. We propose an iterative notion of improvement between successive generations of agents, rather than seeking to maximise a singular objective, allowing us to quantify progress despite tasks being incomparable in terms of achievable rewards. We show that through constructing an open-ended learning process, which dynamically changes the training task distributions and training objectives such that the agent never stops learning, we achieve consistent learning of new behaviours. The resulting agent is able to score reward in every one of our humanly solvable evaluation levels, with behaviour generalising to many held-out points in the universe of tasks. Examples of this zero-shot generalisation include good performance on Hide and Seek, Capture the Flag, and Tag. Through analysis and hand-authored probe tasks we characterise the behaviour of our agent, and find interesting emergent heuristic behaviours such as trial-and-error experimentation, simple tool use, option switching, and cooperation. Finally, we demonstrate that the general capabilities of this agent could unlock larger scale transfer of behaviour through cheap finetuning.",,,,,2024-02-05 10:22,Robi Rahman,,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,DeepMind,,,,GOAT,GOAT,,,

To deal with these three problems, we propose the Hidden-Unit BERT (HuBERT) approach for self-supervised speech representation learning, which utilizes an offline clustering step to provide aligned target labels for a BERT-like prediction loss. A key ingredient of our approach is applying the prediction loss over the masked regions only, which forces the model to learn a combined acoustic and language model over the continuous inputs. HuBERT relies primarily on the consistency of the unsupervised clustering step rather than the intrinsic quality of the assigned cluster labels. Starting with a simple k-means teacher of 100 clusters, and using two iterations of clustering, the HuBERT model either matches or improves upon the state-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 performance on the Librispeech (960h) and Libri-light (60,000h) benchmarks with 10min, 1h, 10h, 100h, and 960h fine-tuning subsets.

(1) We introduce knowledge inheritance to accelerate the pre-training process by exploiting existing PLMs instead of training models from scratch. (2) We explore the best practice of prompt tuning with large-scale PLMs. Compared with conventional fine-tuning, prompt tuning significantly reduces the number of task-specific parameters. (3) We implement a new inference toolkit, namely InfMoE, for using large-scale PLMs with limited computational resources. Based on our cost-effective pipeline, we pre-train two models: an encoder-decoder bilingual model with 11 billion parameters (CPM-2) and its corresponding MoE version with 198 billion parameters. In our experiments, we compare CPM-2 with mT5 on downstream tasks. Experimental results show that CPM-2 has excellent general language intelligence.

While representation learning in NLP has transitioned to training on raw text without human annotations, visual and vision-language representations still rely heavily on curated training datasets that are expensive or require expert knowledge. For vision applications, representations are mostly learned using datasets with explicit class labels such as ImageNet or OpenImages. For vision-language, popular datasets like Conceptual Captions, MSCOCO, or CLIP all involve a non-trivial data collection (and cleaning) process. This costly curation process limits the size of datasets and hence hinders the scaling of trained models. In this paper, we leverage a noisy dataset of over one billion image alt-text pairs, obtained without expensive filtering or post-processing steps in the Conceptual Captions dataset. A simple dual-encoder architecture learns to align visual and language representations of the image and text pairs using a contrastive loss. We show that the scale of our corpus can make up for its noise and leads to state-of-the-art representations even with such a simple learning scheme. Our visual representation achieves strong performance when transferred to classification tasks such as ImageNet and VTAB. The aligned visual and language representations enables zero-shot image classification and also set new state-of-the-art results on Flickr30K and MSCOCO image-text retrieval benchmarks, even when compared with more sophisticated cross-attention models.

In this paper we propose a new model architecture DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention) that improves the BERT and RoBERTa models using two novel techniques. The first is the disentangled attention mechanism, where each word is represented using two vectors that encode its content and position, respectively, and the attention weights among words are computed using disentangled matrices on their contents and relative positions, respectively. Second, an enhanced mask decoder is used to incorporate absolute positions in the decoding layer to predict the masked tokens in model pre-training. In addition, a new virtual adversarial training method is used for fine-tuning to improve models' generalization. We show that these techniques significantly improve the efficiency of model pre-training and the performance of both natural language understanding (NLU) and natural langauge generation (NLG) downstream tasks. Compared to RoBERTa-Large, a DeBERTa model trained on half of the training data performs consistently better on a wide range of NLP tasks, achieving improvements on MNLI by +0.9% (90.2% vs. 91.1%), on SQuAD v2.0 by +2.3% (88.4% vs. 90.7%) and RACE by +3.6% (83.2% vs. 86.8%). Notably, we scale up DeBERTa by training a larger version that consists of 48 Transform layers with 1.5 billion parameters. The significant performance boost makes the single DeBERTa model surpass the human performance on the SuperGLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019a) for the first time in terms of macro-average score (89.9 versus 89.8), and the ensemble DeBERTa model sits atop the SuperGLUE leaderboard as of January 6, 2021, out performing the human baseline by a decent margin (90.3 versus 89.8).",,,,,2024-02-01 10:23,Robi Rahman,,Multinational,Microsoft,,,,DeBERTa,,,,

This observation leads us to design a simplified architecture that requires minor code changes upon the original vision transformer. The benefits of the proposed judiciously-selected design are threefold: (1) NesT converges faster and requires much less training data to achieve good generalization on both ImageNet and small datasets like CIFAR; (2) when extending our key ideas to image generation, NesT leads to a strong decoder that is 8× faster than previous transformer-based generators; and (3) we show that decoupling the feature learning and abstraction processes via this nested hierarchy in our design enables constructing a novel method (named GradCAT) for visually interpreting the learned model.

However, training these models efficiently is challenging for two reasons: a) GPU memory capacity is limited, making it impossible to fit large models on even a multi-GPU server, and b) the number of compute operations required to train these models can result in unrealistically long training times. Consequently, new methods of model parallelism such as tensor and pipeline parallelism have been proposed. Unfortunately, naive usage of these methods leads to fundamental scaling issues at thousands of GPUs, e.g., due to expensive cross-node communication or devices spending significant time waiting on other devices to make progress.
In this paper, we show how different types of parallelism methods (tensor, pipeline, and data parallelism) can be composed to scale to thousands of GPUs and models with trillions of parameters. We survey techniques for pipeline parallelism and propose a novel interleaved pipeline parallelism schedule that can improve throughput by 10+% with memory footprint comparable to existing approaches.

Still it is a mystery how MoE layers bring quality gains by leveraging the parameters with sparse activation. In this work, we investigate several key factors in sparse expert models. We observe that load imbalance may not be a significant problem affecting model quality, contrary to the perspectives of recent studies, while the number of sparsely activated experts k and expert capacity C in top-k routing can significantly make a difference in this context. Furthermore, we take a step forward to propose a simple method called expert prototyping that splits experts into different prototypes and applies k top-1 routing. This strategy improves the model quality but maintains constant computational costs, and our further exploration on extremely large-scale models reflects that it is more effective in training larger models. We push the model scale to over 1 trillion parameters and implement it on solely 480 NVIDIA V100-32GB GPUs, in comparison with the recent SOTAs on 2048 TPU cores.

We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on.

Through an enormous experimental effort, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years. Despite recent progress, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14), demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods.

We demonstrate the capability to train very large DLRMs with up to 12 Trillion parameters and show that we can attain 40 × speedup in terms of time to solution over previous systems. We achieve this by (i) designing the ZionEX platform with dedicated scale-out network, provisioned with high bandwidth, optimal topology and efficient transport (ii) implementing an optimized PyTorch-based training stack supporting both model and data parallelism (iii) developing sharding algorithms capable of hierarchical partitioning of the embedding tables along row, column dimensions and load balancing them across multiple workers; (iv) adding high-performance core operators while retaining flexibility to support optimizers with fully deterministic updates (v) leveraging reduced precision communications, multi-level memory hierarchy (HBM+DDR+SSD) and pipelining.

By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora.

direct set prediction problem. Our approach streamlines the detection
pipeline, effectively removing the need for many hand-designed components like a non-maximum suppression procedure or anchor generation
that explicitly encode our prior knowledge about the task. The main
ingredients of the new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or
DETR, are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Given
a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output
the final set of predictions in parallel. The new model is conceptually
simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other
modern detectors. DETR demonstrates accuracy and run-time performance on par with the well-established and highly-optimized Faster RCNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection dataset. Moreover, DETR can be easily generalized to produce panoptic segmentation
in a unified manner. We show that it significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Training code and pretrained models are available at

Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures.

Conventional approaches either manually design or use neural architecture search (NAS) to find a specialized neural network and train it from scratch for each case, which is computationally prohibitive (causing CO2 emission as much as 5 cars' lifetime) thus unscalable. In this work, we propose to train a once-for-all (OFA) network that supports diverse architectural settings by decoupling training and search, to reduce the cost. We can quickly get a specialized sub-network by selecting from the OFA network without additional training. To efficiently train OFA networks, we also propose a novel progressive shrinking algorithm, a generalized pruning method that reduces the model size across many more dimensions than pruning (depth, width, kernel size, and resolution). It can obtain a surprisingly large number of sub-networks (>1019) that can fit different hardware platforms and latency constraints while maintaining the same level of accuracy as training independently. On diverse edge devices, OFA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) NAS methods (up to 4.0% ImageNet top1 accuracy improvement over MobileNetV3, or same accuracy but 1.5x faster than MobileNetV3, 2.6x faster than EfficientNet w.r.t measured latency) while reducing many orders of magnitude GPU hours and CO2 emission.

Then, instead of training a model that predicts the original identities of the corrupted tokens, we train a discriminative model that predicts whether each token in the corrupted input was replaced by a generator sample or not. Thorough experiments demonstrate this new pre-training task is more efficient than MLM because the task is defined over all input tokens rather than just the small subset that was masked out. As a result, the contextual representations learned by our approach substantially outperform the ones learned by BERT given the same model size, data, and compute. The gains are particularly strong for small models; for example, we train a model on one GPU for 4 days that outperforms GPT (trained using 30x more compute) on the GLUE natural language understanding benchmark. Our approach also works well at scale, where it performs comparably to RoBERTa and XLNet while using less than 1/4 of their compute and outperforms them when using the same amount of compute.",,,,,2024-01-22 14:05,Robi Rahman,,"United States of America,Multinational,Multinational","Stanford University, Google, Google Brain",,,,ELECTRA,,,,

This problem is of fundamental importance as the structure of a protein largely determines its function; however, protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures. Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of mean force that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP13)—a blind assessment of the state of the field—AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template modelling (TM) scores of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains. AlphaFold represents a considerable advance in protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction of proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for homologous proteins have been experimentally determined.",,,,Speculative,2024-02-05 10:33,Robi Rahman,,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,DeepMind,,,,AlphaFold,,,,

MuZero learns a model that, when applied iteratively, predicts the quantities most directly relevant to planning: the reward, the action-selection policy, and the value function. When evaluated on 57 different Atari games - the canonical video game environment for testing AI techniques, in which model-based planning approaches have historically struggled - our new algorithm achieved a new state of the art.

Most scientific experiments have controls, confounds which are removed from the data, to ensure that subjects cannot perform a task by exploiting trivial correlations in the data. Historically, large machine learning and computer vision datasets have lacked such controls. This has resulted in models that must be fine-tuned for new datasets and perform better on datasets than in real-world applications. When tested on ObjectNet, object detectors show a 40-45% drop in performance, with respect to their performance on other benchmarks, due to the controls for biases. Controls make ObjectNet robust to fine-tuning showing only small performance increases. We develop a highly automated platform that enables gathering datasets with controls by crowdsourcing image capturing and annotation. ObjectNet is the same size as the ImageNet test set (50,000 images), and by design does not come paired with a training set in order to encourage generalization. The dataset is both easier than ImageNet – objects are largely centered and unoccluded – and harder, due to the controls. Although we focus on object recognition here, data with controls can be gathered at scale using automated tools throughout machine learning to generate datasets that exercise models in new ways thus providing valuable feedback to researchers.

In the domain of robotic locomotion, deep RL could enable learning locomotion skills with minimal engineering and without an explicit model of the robot dynamics. Unfortunately, applying deep RL to real-world robotic tasks is exceptionally difficult, primarily due to poor sample complexity and sensitivity to hyperparameters. While hyperparameters can be easily tuned in simulated domains, tuning may be prohibitively expensive on physical systems, such as legged robots, that can be damaged through extensive trial-and-error learning. In this paper, we propose a sample-efficient deep RL algorithm based on maximum entropy RL that requires minimal per-task tuning and only a modest number of trials to learn neural network policies. We apply this method to learning walking gaits on a real-world Minitaur robot. Our method can acquire a stable gait from scratch directly in the real world in about two hours, without relying on any model or simulation, and the resulting policy is robust to moderate variations in the environment. We further show that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated benchmarks with a single set of hyperparameters.

Semi-supervised learning has emerged as an important paradigm in protein modeling due to the high cost of acquiring supervised protein labels, but the current literature is fragmented when it comes to datasets and standardized evaluation techniques. To facilitate progress in this field, we introduce the Tasks Assessing Protein Embeddings (TAPE), a set of five biologically relevant semi-supervised learning tasks spread across different domains of protein biology. We curate tasks into specific training, validation, and test splits to ensure that each task tests biologically relevant generalization that transfers to real-life scenarios. We benchmark a range of approaches to semi-supervised protein representation learning, which span recent work as well as canonical sequence learning techniques. We find that self-supervised pretraining is helpful for almost all models on all tasks, more than doubling performance in some cases. Despite this increase, in several cases features learned by self-supervised pretraining still lag behind features extracted by state-of-the-art non-neural techniques. This gap in performance suggests a huge opportunity for innovative architecture design and improved modeling

However, existing MCTS based NAS approaches often utilize manually designed action space, which is not directly related to the performance metric to be optimized (e.g., accuracy), leading to sample-inefficient explorations of architectures. To improve the sample efficiency, this paper proposes Latent Action Neural Architecture Search (LaNAS), which learns actions to recursively partition the search space into good or bad regions that contain networks with similar performance metrics. During the search phase, as different action sequences lead to regions with different performance, the search efficiency can be significantly improved by biasing towards the good regions. On three NAS tasks, empirical results demonstrate that LaNAS is at least an order more sample efficient than baseline methods including evolutionary algorithms, Bayesian optimizations, and random search. When applied in practice, both one-shot and regular LaNAS consistently outperform existing results. Particularly, LaNAS achieves 99.0% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 80.8% top1 accuracy at 600 MFLOPS on ImageNet in only 800 samples, significantly outperforming AmoebaNet with 33x fewer samples.

In this paper, we introduce novel approximations of the primal and dual SWD. Instead of using a large number of random projections, as it is done by conventional SWD approximation methods, we propose to approximate SWDs with a small number of parameterized orthogonal projections in an end-to-end deep learning fashion.

But whereas AlphaZero required thousands of TPUs over several days and ELF required thousands of GPUs over two weeks, KataGo surpasses ELF's final model after only 19 days on fewer than 30 GPUs. Much of the speedup involves non-domain-specific improvements that might directly transfer to other problems.

However, the prohibitive computational demand of conventional NAS algorithms (e.g. 104 GPU hours) makes it difficult to \emph{directly} search the architectures on large-scale tasks (e.g. ImageNet). Differentiable NAS can reduce the cost of GPU hours via a continuous representation of network architecture but suffers from the high GPU memory consumption issue (grow linearly w.r.t. candidate set size). As a result, they need to utilize~\emph{proxy} tasks, such as training on a smaller dataset, or learning with only a few blocks, or training just for a few epochs. These architectures optimized on proxy tasks are not guaranteed to be optimal on the target task. In this paper, we present \emph{ProxylessNAS} that can \emph{directly} learn the architectures for large-scale target tasks and target hardware platforms. We address the high memory consumption issue of differentiable NAS and reduce the computational cost (GPU hours and GPU memory) to the same level of regular training while still allowing a large candidate set. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of directness and specialization. On CIFAR-10, our model achieves 2.08\% test error with only 5.7M parameters, better than the previous state-of-the-art architecture AmoebaNet-B, while using 6× fewer parameters. On ImageNet, our model achieves 3.1\% better top-1 accuracy than MobileNetV2, while being 1.2× faster with measured GPU latency. We also apply ProxylessNAS to specialize neural architectures for hardware with direct hardware metrics (e.g. latency) and provide insights for efficient CNN architecture design.",,,,,2024-02-02 18:27,Robi Rahman,,United States of America,Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),,,,ProxylessNAS,,,,

LSTMs usually have 4*(n*m+n*n+n) parameters, where n=input size and m=output size.

This DNS + LSTM takes as input the concatenation of the previous layer of size n and R read vectors of size W=32; and outputs m units plus an interface vector of size (W*R) + 3*W + 5*R + 3, for a total of about 4*(n+R*W)*((m+(W*R) + 3*W + 5*R + 3)+(n+R*32)+1) parameters

I assume R=2 since that seems implied by the previous paper (?)

The first VU has as input the visual embedding (size 256), the previous action (size 540) and the previous reward (size 3), for a total size of 256+540+3 = 799. The output is size 512.

30 * 2e9 = 6e10",,,,,,Self-supervised learning,$130.36,,Industry,"Recent progress in artificial intelligence through reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great success on increasingly complex single-agent environments and two-player turn-based games. However, the real-world contains multiple agents, each learning and acting independently to cooperate and compete with other agents, and environments reflecting this degree of complexity remain an open challenge. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that an agent can achieve human-level in a popular 3D multiplayer first-person video game, Quake III Arena Capture the Flag, using only pixels and game points as input. These results were achieved by a novel two-tier optimisation process in which a population of independent RL agents are trained concurrently from thousands of parallel matches with agents playing in teams together and against each other on randomly generated environments. Each agent in the population learns its own internal reward signal to complement the sparse delayed reward from winning, and selects actions using a novel temporally hierarchical representation that enables the agent to reason at multiple timescales. During game-play, these agents display human-like behaviours such as navigating, following, and defending based on a rich learned representation that is shown to encode high-level game knowledge. In an extensive tournament-style evaluation the trained agents exceeded the win-rate of strong human players both as teammates and opponents, and proved far stronger than existing state-of-the-art agents. These results demonstrate a significant jump in the capabilities of artificial agents, bringing us closer to the goal of human-level intelligence.",,,,,2024-02-01 09:45,Robi Rahman,,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,DeepMind,,,,Population-based DRL,,,,

Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant, labeled data for learning these specific tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative fine-tuning on each specific task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during fine-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that use architectures specifically crafted for each task, significantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied.

AGZ had two models, one of which was small and another of which was large. The compute for AGZ is for the large model, which has 40 residual blocks instead of 20.

A second way of looking at this... we believe multiple TPUs were used for training. 29 million games * 211 moves per game on average * 0.8 seconds per move = 4.8952E+09 seconds of player-time across all TPUs.

4.8952E+09 seconds of player-time / (40 days * 24 * 60 * 60 seconds of real time) ~= 1,416 players

4 TPUs per player => 4.8952E+09 * 4 = 1.95808E+10 TPU-seconds
Total compute = 1.95808E+10 TPU-seconds * 92E+12 FLOP/(TPU-second) * 0.4 = 7.2e23 FLOP

These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo's own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo's games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration.

Generally, deep neural network architectures are stacks consisting of a large number of convolutional layers, and they perform downsampling along the spatial dimension via pooling to reduce memory usage. Concurrently, the feature map dimension (i.e., the number of channels) is sharply increased at downsampling locations, which is essential to ensure effective performance because it increases the diversity of high-level attributes. This also applies to residual networks and is very closely related to their performance. In this research, instead of sharply increasing the feature map dimension at units that perform downsampling, we gradually increase the feature map dimension at all units to involve as many locations as possible. This design, which is discussed in depth together with our new insights, has proven to be an effective means of improving generalization ability. Furthermore, we propose a novel residual unit capable of further improving the classification accuracy with our new network architecture.

learning methods""",4652,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Deep networks have been successfully applied to learn transferable features for adapting models from a source domain to a different target domain. In this paper, we present joint adaptation networks (JAN), which learn a transfer network by aligning the joint distributions of multiple domain-specific layers across domains based on a joint maximum mean discrepancy (JMMD) criterion. Adversarial training strategy is adopted to maximize JMMD such that the distributions of the source and target domains are made more distinguishable. Learning can be performed by stochastic gradient descent with the gradients computed by back-propagation in linear-time.

Since 2012, there have been significant advances in representation capabilities of the models and computational capabilities of GPUs. But the size of the biggest dataset has surprisingly remained constant. What will happen if we increase the dataset size by 10x or 100x? This paper takes a step towards clearing the clouds of mystery surrounding the relationship between `enormous data' and visual deep learning. By exploiting the JFT-300M dataset which has more than 375M noisy labels for 300M images, we investigate how the performance of current vision tasks would change if this data was used for representation learning. Our paper delivers some surprising (and some expected) findings. First, we find that the performance on vision tasks increases logarithmically based on volume of training data size. Second, we show that representation learning (or pre-training) still holds a lot of promise. One can improve performance on many vision tasks by just training a better base model. Finally, as expected, we present new state-of-the-art results for different vision tasks including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and human pose estimation.

core idea is to equip each original convolutional layer

element-wise multiplication of the ReLU outputs of these
two parallel layers produces the layer-wise output. The
combined layer is potentially more discriminative than the
original convolutional layer, and its inference is faster for
two reasons: 1) the zero cells of the LCCL feature maps will
remain zero after element-wise multiplication, and thus it is
safe to skip the calculation of the corresponding high-cost
convolution in the original convolutional layer; 2) LCCL
is very fast if it is implemented as a 1 × 1 convolution or
only a single filter shared by all channels. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ILSCRC-2012

Unfortunately, NMT systems are known to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation inference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words. These issues have hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both accuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google's Neural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder layers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final translation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference computations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited set of common sub-word units (""wordpieces"") for both input and output. This method provides a good balance between the flexibility of ""character""-delimited models and the efficiency of ""word""-delimited models, naturally handles translation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the system. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and uses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that is most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. On the WMT'14 English-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive results to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of isolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60% compared to Google's phrase-based production system.",,,,,2024-02-01 10:08,Robi Rahman,,Multinational,Google,,,,GNMT,GNMT,,,

These inefficiencies mostly stem from following an ad hoc procedure. We propose a simple architecture, called SimpleNet, based on a set of designing principles, with which we empirically show, a well-crafted yet simple and reasonably deep architecture can perform on par with deeper and more complex architectures. SimpleNet provides a good tradeoff between the computation/memory efficiency and the accuracy. Our simple 13-layer architecture outperforms most of the deeper and complex architectures to date such as VGGNet, ResNet, and GoogleNet on several well-known benchmarks while having 2 to 25 times fewer number of parameters and operations. This makes it very handy for embedded systems or systems with computational and memory limitations. We achieved state-of-theart result on CIFAR10 outperforming several heavier architectures, near state of the art on MNIST and highly competitive results on CIFAR100 and SVHN.

We first describe an operator for tabular representations, the consistent Bellman operator, which incorporates a notion of local policy consistency. We show that this local consistency leads to an increase in the action gap at each state; increasing this gap, we argue, mitigates the undesirable effects of approximation and estimation errors on the induced greedy policies. This operator can also be applied to discretized continuous space and time problems, and we provide empirical results evidencing superior performance in this context. Extending the idea of a locally consistent operator, we then derive sufficient conditions for an operator to preserve optimality, leading to a family of operators which includes our consistent Bellman operator. As corollaries we provide a proof of optimality for Baird's advantage learning algorithm and derive other gap-increasing operators with interesting properties. We conclude with an empirical study on 60 Atari 2600 games illustrating the strong potential of these new operators.",,,,,2024-01-19 18:10,Robi Rahman,,Multinational,Google DeepMind,,,,Advantage Learning,,,,

Key to our approach is our application of HPC techniques, resulting in a 7x speedup over our previous system. Because of this efficiency, experiments that previously took weeks now run in days. This enables us to iterate more quickly to identify superior architectures and algorithms. As a result, in several cases, our system is competitive with the transcription of human workers when benchmarked on standard datasets.

In this work, we study rectifier neural networks for image classification from two aspects. First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on our PReLU networks (PReLU-nets), we achieve 4.94% top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26% relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66%).

Max-pooling act on the hidden layers of the network, reducing their size by an integer multiplicative factor alpha. The amazing by-product of discarding 75% of your data is that you build into the network a degree of invariance with respect to translations and elastic distortions. However, if you simply alternate convolutional layers with max-pooling layers, performance is limited due to the rapid reduction in spatial size, and the disjoint nature of the pooling regions. We have formulated a fractional version of max-pooling where alpha is allowed to take non-integer values. Our version of max-pooling is stochastic as there are lots of different ways of constructing suitable pooling regions.

Motivated by the problem of online handwriting recognition, we developed a CNN for processing spatially-sparse inputs; a character drawn with a one-pixel wide pen on a high resolution grid looks like a sparse matrix. Taking advantage of the sparsity allowed us more efficiently to train and test large, deep CNNs. On the CASIA-OLHWDB1.1 dataset containing 3755 character classes we get a test error of 3.82%.

with leaky integration, advanced momentum techniques, using more powerful output probability models, and encouraging sparser gradients to help symmetry breaking and credit assignment.

In this paper, we improve their performance by providing a contextual real-valued input vector in association with each word. This vector is used to convey contextual information about the sentence being modeled. By performing Latent Dirichlet Allocation using a block of preceding text, we achieve a topic-conditioned RNNLM. This approach has the key advantage of avoiding the data fragmentation associated with building multiple topic models on different data subsets. We report perplexity results on the Penn Treebank data, where we achieve a new state-of-the-art. We further apply the model to the Wall Street Journal speech recognition task, where we observe

We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous SGD on a cluster with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days.

Control experiments show that this feature detector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane rotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level concepts such as cat faces and human bodies.

However, CIFAR-10 is a labeled subset of all the training data used

""The tiny images dataset on which we based all of our experiments was collected by colleagues at MIT and NYU over the span of six months; it is described in detail in [14]. They assembled it by searching the web for images of every non-abstract English noun in the lexical database WordNet[15, 8]. They used several search engines, including Google, Flickr, and Altavista and kept roughly the rst 3000 results for each search term. After collecting all the images for a particular search term, they removed perfect duplicates and images in which an excessively large portion of the pixels were white, as they tended to be synthetic gures rather than natural images. The search term used to nd an image provides it with a rough label, although it is extremely unreliable due to the nature of online image search technology.
In total, the dataset contains 80 million colour images downscaled to 32 × 32 and spread out across 79000 search terms. Most of our experiments with unsupervised learning were performed on a subset of about 2 million images.""

""We paid students to label a subset of the tiny images dataset...

It
is, in principle, an excellent dataset for unsupervised training of deep generative models, but previous
researchers who have tried this have found it dicult to learn a good set of lters from the images.
We show how to train a multi-layer generative model that learns to extract meaningful features which
resemble those found in the human visual cortex. Using a novel parallelization algorithm to distribute
the work among multiple machines connected on a network, we show how training such a model can be
done in reasonable time.
A second problematic aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels
which makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments. We created two sets of reliable labels.
The CIFAR-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the CIFAR-100 set has 600 examples of
each of 100 non-overlapping classes. Using these labels, we show that object recognition is signicantly
improved by pre-training a layer of features on a large set of unlabeled tiny images.",,,,Likely,2024-02-02 18:18,Anonymous,,Canada,University of Toronto,,,,RBM Image Classifier,,,,

- Translation probability model phi
- The distortion probability distribution d
- A langage model p_LM
- A length factor w

Several translation probability models are considered. The most performant one is the AP word alignment model. The sentence length preferred by the authors is 3 words maximum. In the biggest corpus considered (320k phrase pairs) it produces a phrase translation probability table of 1996k entries.

The distortion probability model d is taken from  (Marcu and Wong, 2002).

The distortion probability model must have ~10 parameters at most

The language model p_LM is a back off trigram model from (Seymore and Rosenfeld,1997). AFAIK the cutoff used is not specified. Based on the example on section 4.3 of (Seymore and Rosefeld, 1997), a trigram probability model has about 3866964 + 2674322 + 641604 parameters.

""For each possible phrase translation anywhere in the sentence (we call it a translation option), we multiply its phrase translation probability with the language model probability for the generated English phrase. As language model probability we use the unigram probability for the first word, the bigram probability for the second, and the trigram probability for all following words""

The length factor w is an additional single parameter.

""In order to calibrate the output length, we introduce a
factor w for each generated English word in addition to
the trigram language model ""

In summary, the parameter count seems to be dominated by the trigram language model and the word alignment phrase translation model. ",,,,,20000000,"[WORDS]

General protein language models have been shown to summarize the semantics of protein sequences into representations that are useful for state-of-the-art predictive methods. However, for antibody specific problems, such as restoring residues lost due to sequencing errors, a model trained solely on antibodies may be more powerful. Antibodies are one of the few protein types where the volume of sequence data needed for such language models is available, e.g. in the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) database.

Results
Here, we introduce AbLang, a language model trained on the antibody sequences in the OAS database. We demonstrate the power of AbLang by using it to restore missing residues in antibody sequence data, a key issue with B-cell receptor repertoire sequencing, e.g. over 40% of OAS sequences are missing the first 15 amino acids. AbLang restores the missing residues of antibody sequences better than using IMGT germlines or the general protein language model ESM-1b. Further, AbLang does not require knowledge of the germline of the antibody and is seven times faster than ESM-1b.",,,,Confident,2024-02-02 18:18,Anonymous,,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,University of Oxford,,,,,,,,

Deciphering the language of non-coding DNA is one of the fundamental problems in genome research. Gene regulatory code is highly complex due to the existence of polysemy and distant semantic relationship, which previous informatics methods often fail to capture especially in data-scarce scenarios.

Results
To address this challenge, we developed a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder representation, named DNABERT, to capture global and transferrable understanding of genomic DNA sequences based on up and downstream nucleotide contexts. We compared DNABERT to the most widely used programs for genome-wide regulatory elements prediction and demonstrate its ease of use, accuracy and efficiency. We show that the single pre-trained transformers model can simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art performance on prediction of promoters, splice sites and transcription factor binding sites, after easy fine-tuning using small task-specific labeled data. Further, DNABERT enables direct visualization of nucleotide-level importance and semantic relationship within input sequences for better interpretability and accurate identification of conserved sequence motifs and functional genetic variant candidates. Finally, we demonstrate that pre-trained DNABERT with human genome can even be readily applied to other organisms with exceptional performance. We anticipate that the pre-trained DNABERT model can be fined tuned to many other sequence analyses tasks.",,Fully open-source,,Likely,2024-02-02 18:18,Anonymous,,,,,,,,,,,

[2.2 Data preparation]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Motivation
The accumulation of sequencing data has enabled researchers to predict the interactions between RNA sequences and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) using novel machine learning techniques. However, existing models are often difficult to interpret and require additional information to sequences. Bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT) is a language-based deep learning model that is highly interpretable. Therefore, a model based on BERT architecture can potentially overcome such limitations.

Results
Here, we propose BERT-RBP as a model to predict RNA–RBP interactions by adapting the BERT architecture pretrained on a human reference genome.

Although there are already many deep learning methods for predicting the sequence specificities of DBPs, they face two challenges as follows. Classic deep learning methods for DBPs prediction usually fail to capture the dependencies between genomic sequences since their commonly used one-hot codes are mutually orthogonal. Besides, these methods usually perform poorly when samples are inadequate. To address these two challenges, we developed a novel language model for mining DBPs using human genomic data and ChIP-seq datasets with decaying learning rates, named DNA Fine-tuned Language Model (DFLM). It can capture the dependencies between genome sequences based on the context of human genomic data and then fine-tune the features of DBPs tasks using different ChIP-seq datasets. First, we compared DFLM with the existing widely used methods on 69 datasets and we achieved excellent performance. Moreover, we conducted comparative experiments on complex DBPs and small datasets. The results show that DFLM still achieved a significant improvement. Finally, through visualization analysis of one-hot encoding and DFLM, we found that one-hot encoding completely cut off the dependencies of DNA sequences themselves, while DFLM using language models can well represent the dependency of DNA sequences.

Significant improvements in the prediction of protein residue–residue contacts are observed in the recent years. These contacts, predicted using a variety of coevolution-based and machine learning methods, are the key contributors to the recent progress in ab initio protein structure prediction, as demonstrated in the recent CASP experiments. Continuing the development of new methods to reliably predict contact maps is essential to further improve ab initio structure prediction.

Results
In this paper we discuss DNCON2, an improved protein contact map predictor based on two-level deep convolutional neural networks. It consists of six convolutional neural networks—the first five predict contacts at 6, 7.5, 8, 8.5 and 10 Å distance thresholds, and the last one uses these five predictions as additional features to predict final contact maps. On the free-modeling datasets in CASP10, 11 and 12 experiments, DNCON2 achieves mean precisions of 35, 50 and 53.4%, respectively, higher than 30.6% by MetaPSICOV on CASP10 dataset, 34% by MetaPSICOV on CASP11 dataset and 46.3% by Raptor-X on CASP12 dataset, when top L/5 long-range contacts are evaluated. We attribute the improved performance of DNCON2 to the inclusion of short- and medium-range contacts into training, two-level approach to prediction, use of the state-of-the-art optimization and activation functions, and a novel deep learning architecture that allows each filter in a convolutional layer to access all the input features of a protein of arbitrary length.",,Fully open-source,,Likely,2024-02-02 18:18,Anonymous,,,,,,,,,,,

While Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) sets continue to expand our understanding of the mutational landscape of single proteins, the results continue to challenge analyses. Protein Language Models (pLMs) use the latest deep learning (DL) algorithms to leverage growing databases of protein sequences. These methods learn to predict missing or masked amino acids from the context of entire sequence regions. Here, we used pLM representations (embeddings) to predict sequence conservation and SAV effects without multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). Embeddings alone predicted residue conservation almost as accurately from single sequences as ConSeq using MSAs (two-state Mat- thews Correlation Coefficient—MCC—for ProtT5 embeddings of 0.596 ± 0.006 vs. 0.608 ± 0.006 for ConSeq). Inputting the conservation prediction along with BLOSUM62 substitution scores and pLM mask reconstruction probabilities into a simplistic logistic regression (LR) ensemble for Variant Effect Score Prediction without Alignments (VESPA) predicted SAV effect magnitude without any optimization on DMS data. Comparing predictions for a standard set of 39 DMS experiments to other methods (incl. ESM-1v, DeepSequence, and GEMME) revealed our approach as competitive with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods using MSA input. No method outperformed all others, neither consistently nor statistically significantly, independently of the performance measure applied (Spearman and Pearson correlation). Finally, we investigated binary effect predictions on DMS experiments for four human proteins.

We apply it to three prototypical tasks, namely enzyme class prediction, gene ontology prediction and remote homology and fold detection. The proposed method performs on par with state-of-the-art algorithms that were tailored to these specific tasks or, for two out of three tasks, even outperforms them. These results stress the possibility of inferring protein properties from the sequence alone and, on more general grounds, the prospects of modern natural language processing methods in omics.",,Weights available,,Likely,2024-02-02 18:18,Anonymous,,Germany,"Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute

For a query sequence, the pipeline starts with the collection of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) from multiple genome and metagenome sequence databases using two complementary Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based searching tools. Three profile matrices, built on covariance, precision, and pseudolikelihood maximization respectively, are then created from the MSAs, which are used as the input features of a deep residual convolutional neural network architecture for contact-map training and prediction. Two ensembling strategies have been proposed to integrate the matrix features through end-to-end training and stacking, resulting in two complementary programs called TripletRes and ResTriplet, respectively. For the 31 free-modeling domains that do not have homologous templates in the PDB, TripletRes and ResTriplet generated comparable results with an average accuracy of 0.640 and 0.646, respectively, for the top L/5 long-range predictions, where 71% and 74% of the cases have an accuracy above 0.5. Detailed data analyses showed that the strength of the pipeline is due to the sensitive MSA construction and the advanced strategies for coevolutionary feature ensembling. Domain splitting was also found to help enhance the contact prediction performance. Nevertheless, contact models for tail regions, which often involve a high number of alignment gaps, and for targets with few homologous sequences are still suboptimal. Development of new approaches where the model is specifically trained on these regions and targets might help address these problems.",,Weights available,,Likely,2024-02-02 18:18,Anonymous,,,,,,,,,,,

Predicting protein function and structure from sequence is one important challenge for computational biology. For 26 years, most state-of-the-art approaches combined machine learning and evolutionary information. However, for some applications retrieving related proteins is becoming too time-consuming. Additionally, evolutionary information is less powerful for small families, e.g. for proteins from the Dark Proteome. Both these problems are addressed by the new methodology introduced here.
Results
We introduced a novel way to represent protein sequences as continuous vectors (embeddings) by using the language model ELMo taken from natural language processing. By modeling protein sequences, ELMo effectively captured the biophysical properties of the language of life from unlabeled big data (UniRef50). We refer to these new embeddings as SeqVec (Sequence-to-Vector) and demonstrate their effectiveness by training simple neural networks for two different tasks. At the per-residue level, secondary structure (Q3 = 79% ± 1, Q8 = 68% ± 1) and regions with intrinsic disorder (MCC = 0.59 ± 0.03) were predicted significantly better than through one-hot encoding or through Word2vec-like approaches. At the per-protein level, subcellular localization was predicted in ten classes (Q10 = 68% ± 1) and membrane-bound were distinguished from water-soluble proteins (Q2 = 87% ± 1). Although SeqVec embeddings generated the best predictions from single sequences, no solution improved over the best existing method using evolutionary information. Nevertheless, our approach improved over some popular methods using evolutionary information and for some proteins even did beat the best. Thus, they prove to condense the underlying principles of protein sequences. Overall, the important novelty is speed: where the lightning-fast HHblits needed on average about two minutes to generate the evolutionary information for a target protein, SeqVec created embeddings on average in 0.03 s. As this speed-up is independent of the size of growing sequence databases, SeqVec provides a highly scalable approach for the analysis of big data in proteomics, i.e. microbiome or metaproteome analysis.
Conclusion
Transfer-learning succeeded to extract information from unlabeled sequence databases relevant for various protein prediction tasks. SeqVec modeled the language of life, namely the principles underlying protein sequences better than any features suggested by textbooks and prediction methods. The exception is evolutionary information, however, that information is not available on the level of a single sequence.",,Weights available,,Likely,2024-02-02 18:18,Anonymous,,Germany,Technical University of Munich,,,,,,,,

Evolutionary processes dictate the specificity of genomic contexts in which a gene is found across phylogenetic distances, and these emergent genomic patterns can be leveraged to uncover functional relationships between gene products. Here, we trained a genomic language model (gLM) on millions of metagenomic scaffolds to learn the latent functional and regulatory relationships between genes. gLM learns contextualized protein embeddings that capture the genomic context as well as the protein sequence itself, and appears to encode biologically meaningful and functionally relevant information (e.g. phylogeny, enzymatic function). Our analysis of the attention patterns demonstrates that gLM is learning co-regulated functional modules (i.e. operons).

To this end, we propose to co-fine-tune state-of-the-art vision-language models on both robotic trajectory data and Internet-scale vision-language tasks, such as visual question answering. In contrast to other approaches, we propose a simple, general recipe to achieve this goal: in order to fit both natural language responses and robotic actions into the same format, we express the actions as text tokens and incorporate them directly into the training set of the model in the same way as natural language tokens. We refer to such category of models as vision-language-action models (VLA) and instantiate an example of such a model, which we call RT-2. Our extensive evaluation (6k evaluation trials) shows that our approach leads to performant robotic policies and enables RT-2 to obtain a range of emergent capabilities from Internet-scale training. This includes significantly improved generalization to novel objects, the ability to interpret commands not present in the robot training data (such as placing an object onto a particular number or icon), and the ability to perform rudimentary reasoning in response to user commands (such as picking up the smallest or largest object, or the one closest to another object).

While recently proposed approaches show promise in generalization to novel objects, semantic concepts, or visual distribution shifts, generalization to new tasks remains challenging. For example, a language-conditioned policy trained on pick-and-place tasks will not be able to generalize to a folding task, even if the arm trajectory of folding is similar to pick-and-place. Our key insight is that this kind of generalization becomes feasible if we represent the task through rough trajectory sketches. We propose a policy conditioning method using such rough trajectory sketches, which we call RT-Trajectory, that is practical, easy to specify, and allows the policy to effectively perform new tasks that would otherwise be challenging to perform. We find that trajectory sketches strike a balance between being detailed enough to express low-level motion-centric guidance while being coarse enough to allow the learned policy to interpret the trajectory sketch in the context of situational visual observations. In addition, we show how trajectory sketches can provide a useful interface to communicate with robotic policies: they can be specified through simple human inputs like drawings or videos, or through automated methods such as modern image-generating or waypoint-generating methods.

In this work, we propose AaudioGen, an auto-regressive generative model that generates audio samples conditioned on text inputs. AudioGen operates on a learnt discrete audio representation. The task of text-to-audio generation poses multiple challenges. Due to the way audio travels through a medium, differentiating ``objects'' can be a difficult task (e.g., separating multiple people simultaneously speaking). This is further complicated by real-world recording conditions (e.g., background noise, reverberation, etc.). Scarce text annotations impose another constraint, limiting the ability to scale models. Finally, modeling high-fidelity audio requires encoding audio at high sampling rate, leading to extremely long sequences. To alleviate the aforementioned challenges we propose an augmentation technique that mixes different audio samples, driving the model to internally learn to separate multiple sources.

Such knowledge could be extremely useful to robots aiming to act upon high-level, temporally extended instructions expressed in natural language. However, a significant weakness of language models is that they lack real-world experience, which makes it difficult to leverage them for decision making within a given embodiment. For example, asking a language model to describe how to clean a spill might result in a reasonable narrative, but it may not be applicable to a particular agent, such as a robot, that needs to perform this task in a particular environment. We propose to provide real-world grounding by means of pretrained skills, which are used to constrain the model to propose natural language actions that are both feasible and contextually appropriate. The robot can act as the language model's ""hands and eyes,"" while the language model supplies high-level semantic knowledge about the task. We show how low-level skills can be combined with large language models so that the language model provides high-level knowledge about the procedures for performing complex and temporally-extended instructions, while value functions associated with these skills provide the grounding necessary to connect this knowledge to a particular physical environment. We evaluate our method on a number of real-world robotic tasks, where we show the need for real-world grounding and that this approach is capable of completing long-horizon, abstract, natural language instructions on a mobile manipulator.

This raises the question: do learned attention layers operate similarly to convolutional layers? This work provides evidence that attention layers can perform convolution and, indeed, they often learn to do so in practice. Specifically, we prove that a multi-head self-attention layer with sufficient number of heads is at least as expressive as any convolutional layer. Our numerical experiments then show that self-attention layers attend to pixel-grid patterns similarly to CNN layers, corroborating our analysis. Our code is publicly available.

Perhaps surprisingly, we find that training and scaling strategies may matter more than architectural changes, and further, that the resulting ResNets match recent state-of-the-art models. We show that the best performing scaling strategy depends on the training regime and offer two new scaling strategies: (1) scale model depth in regimes where overfitting can occur (width scaling is preferable otherwise); (2) increase image resolution more slowly than previously recommended (Tan & Le, 2019). Using improved training and scaling strategies, we design a family of ResNet architectures, ResNet-RS, which are 1.7x - 2.7x faster than EfficientNets on TPUs, while achieving similar accuracies on ImageNet. In a large-scale semi-supervised learning setup, ResNet-RS achieves 86.2% top-1 ImageNet accuracy, while being 4.7x faster than EfficientNet NoisyStudent.

The proposed model - TOME - is a Transformer that accesses the information through internal memory layers in which each entity mention in the input passage attends to the mention memory. This approach enables synthesis of and reasoning over many disparate sources of information within a single Transformer model. In experiments using a memory of 150 million Wikipedia mentions, TOME achieves strong performance on several open-domain knowledge-intensive tasks, including the claim verification benchmarks HoVer and FEVER and several entity-based QA benchmarks. We also show that the model learns to attend to informative mentions without any direct supervision.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model PhaseCond on the SQuAD dataset, showing that our model significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art single-layered and multiple-layered attention models. We deepen our results with new findings via both detailed qualitative analysis and visualized examples showing the dynamic changes through multi-layered attention models.",,,,Likely,2024-02-05 09:49,Anonymous,,"United States of America,United States of America","Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), University of Pittsburgh",,,,,,,,

While self-play reinforcement learning has resulted in numerous successes in purely adversarial games like chess, Go, and poker, self-play alone is insufficient for achieving optimal performance in domains involving cooperation with humans. We address this shortcoming by first introducing a planning algorithm we call DiL-piKL that regularizes a reward-maximizing policy toward a human imitation-learned policy. We prove that this is a no-regret learning algorithm under a modified utility function. We then show that DiL-piKL can be extended into a self-play reinforcement learning algorithm we call RL-DiL-piKL that provides a model of human play while simultaneously training an agent that responds well to this human model. We used RL-DiL-piKL to train an agent we name Diplodocus.

We present a method for learning object categories from just a few images (1 /spl sim/ 5). It is based on incorporating ""generic"" knowledge which may be obtained from previously learnt models of unrelated categories. We operate in a variational Bayesian framework: object categories are represented by probabilistic models, and ""prior"" knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The ""posterior"" model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. Our ideas are demonstrated on four diverse categories (human faces, airplanes, motorcycles, spotted cats). Initially three categories are learnt from hundreds of training examples, and a ""prior"" is estimated from these. Then the model of the fourth category is learnt from 1 to 5 training examples, and is used for detecting new exemplars a set of test images.",,,,Likely,2024-02-05 08:00,Anonymous,,"United States of America,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland","California Institute of Technology, University of Oxford",,,,,,,,

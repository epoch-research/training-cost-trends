## NotebookRead Cell ID Issue

### Error Description
When using `NotebookRead` to read the entire notebook, cells display with IDs like "cell-0", "cell-1", etc. However, when attempting to read individual cells using these exact same IDs with the `cell_id` parameter, the tool returns "Cell with ID 'cell-1' not found in notebook" errors.

### Reproduction Steps
1. Use `NotebookRead` without `cell_id` parameter - successfully shows cells with IDs "cell-0", "cell-1", etc.
2. Use `NotebookRead` with `cell_id="cell-1"` - fails with "Cell with ID 'cell-1' not found"
3. Tried variations like `cell_id="0"` and `cell_id=0` - all fail

### Current Workaround
Always read the full notebook structure first rather than trying to read individual cells. The `NotebookEdit` tool appears to work correctly with these cell IDs, suggesting the issue is specific to `NotebookRead` when using the `cell_id` parameter.

### Impact
This makes it impossible to read individual cells for inspection, requiring full notebook reads even when only examining specific cells.

## Python3 Command Not Found - 2025-07-30

### Error Description
When running `python3 cost_analysis_standalone.py`, got "Python was not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft Store, or disable this shortcut from Settings > Apps > Advanced app settings > App execution aliases."

### Situation
User requested to run the cost analysis standalone script with python 3.12. On Windows, `python3` is not recognized as a command - Windows Python installations typically use `python` command instead of `python3`. This is different from Linux/Mac systems where `python3` is the standard command for Python 3.x.

### Solution
Use `python` command instead of `python3` on Windows systems, or check if Python is properly installed and accessible via PATH.
